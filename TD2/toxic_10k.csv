4235	""" no seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that """"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot"""".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says """"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY"""" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.  If you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said """"What language is that?"""" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.  Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between """"nigga"""" and """"nigger"""", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a """"black person"""". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying """"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.""""?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word """"nigger"""" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word """"nigger"""".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.  I forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to """"Winston Churchill"""".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.  You fags have to be humorless, oversensitive, fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted self-importance and your administrative powers.  Well you can go fuck yourselves. IF you ever succeed in getting all sand out of your vaginas.  I joined wikipedia because i wanted to make it better, and that was all i did.  but i guess you cunts actually enjoy bathing aro"	1

That doesn't give you the right to be an absolute jerk to him and insult him just because he didn't respond instantly.  As to why he hasn't responded further, that is quite obvious: he already explained to you his reasoning.  He does not have to defend himself to you, and you are the only person who thinks he is abusive.  I don't expect you to apologize, but know this, if you continue on the path you are on now, you will get blocked.— dαlus Contribs  You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day (as you implied my original complaint was), he didn't even EVENTUALLY address my objections!  Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc. Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY,  why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!  Dodo (and many others) amount to semi-professional BUSYBODIES who strut their stuff by interfering with others' use of WP.  Stop it.   """	1

Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.   You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes.

And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth.

You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too.

The problem is I have a huge crush on him, and he has a crush on this girl in our form called Jane Thomas (I HATE YOU!). She is fat, has greasy hair, a really round face, flabby cheeks and does this really weird thing with her chin, she is a proper girl dog.

It is clear that the person had psychiatric problems as a result of this episode, and that any reasonable person might deduce that such problems might be perpetuated and compounded by the digged determination to print the victim's name. Your 'genie in the bottle' analogy again ignores the points that have been made to you above; just because another publication prints his name doesn't mean WP has to, particularly as WP is more likely to be first port of call for anyone searching for information on the video. As for your hope that the article serves as a cautionary tale - how is the inclusion of his name going to further that 'hope'? Finally, you doidn't answer the question I posed, which in my opinion is the nub: 'perhaps you might put yourself in his shoes for one moment, and then ask yourself whether your determination to include what most agree is a non-essential detail has the potential to cause yet more hurt and upset to the victim here?'	1

143015	Amandajm: Ignorant Muslim & Disgusting Anti-white Racist Reading back on racist, Amandajm - I've come to realize that in addition to his muslim name, he veritably hates white people. He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.  To that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are. (No, I've not gone off the deep end). I received an automatic response email from the FBI stating that they will look into the matter, and will definitley be following up. Racist muslims of this type are tricky and can pose a risk to the US. Also, I sent an email to wiki complaining about this enemy of europeans and americans. I got an email back from wiki stating that he will be reviewed - thank god! His place in wiki - and in the US - shouldn't be secure.	1

I AM NOT """"pushing a P.O.V."""".  If you do not understand basic English grammar, you have no business telling me anything.  FACT: commas are used in this context to separate a list, a series, of related clauses.  Grammar is not a matter of a """"general discussion"""" or """"chatting"""" or a """"point of view"""".  It is a technically precise set of rules, and in this case, a set of rules that demonstrate that the foundation of the issue is a fraud.  THIS IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT, IT IS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE, IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE.  I AM TALKING ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.  FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):   There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.   make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being friendly is a great help.   It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it.   Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article;   Deal with facts   The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns discussed.   The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.   New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion by other editors if you wish.   Do not threaten people: For example, ... having them banned for disagreeing with you.   removing others' comments is sometimes allowed. But you should ... stop if there is any objection.  As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public since there is no """"natural born citizen"""" requirement that is applicable today. That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.  If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal, shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at the foundation of the issue in the article:  No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.  209.112.188.15   """	1

You'll just be dust and completely irrelevant to the world... having never done anything more than edited a website.	1
70020	"""Cut the crap already. Unless you're a pedophile, you don't have anything to worry about. And even then, all you have to do is stay quite about it and you'll be fine. On Wikipedia, we are focused on creating and maintaining an encyclopedia, not a social networking profile. If racists, pedophiles, murderers, thieves or prostitutes find the need to announce themselves as such, then they are at the wrong place. Stop looking at the policy as """"Block on sight"""" and instead look at it as """"Don't disclose controversial information about yourself or otherwise you'll be blocked."""" I think that if you look at it that way, it sounds perfectly fair. Its fair because this is an encyclopedia and there is no need to disclose that kind of information anywhere. back ☎  """	1

I cited it to explain to why I used that imagery in the WP:PA, as otherwise it would appear inexplicably random. The explanation was not, as you seem to think, offered in mitigation. Indeed my original unblock request, which I condensed at the request of admin Hersfold, stated:   The following will help the reviewing admin(s) to understand what otherwise would appear to be a random choice of metaphors.[...] Killer has a picture of a pop-eyed chihuahua dog on her user page,  captioned “I look like this”; and she is in the habit of referring to herself, in her sysopping summaries, as a dog   e.g. “Puppy has spoken.” Stupidly I exploited this canine imagery at Killer’s expense.''   I edited out that section along with others in an effort to comply with Hersfold's request.  My unblock request in no way implies that it is 'somehow OK to insult' you because you refer to yourself as 'puppy'. It simply explains where the idea for the canine imagery came from. It does not attempt to excuse my using it to insult you.  I have apologised, and still do, for my rude and offensive references to you personally in the WP:PA; and ask that you graciously accept my apology as sincere, which it is.   """	1

Truly sad, indeed.    Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's. We have made """"those people"""" rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling. Open your eyes!  And for those reasons, I despise China as well as the politically correct.   Niggardly  It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the """"controversial"""" word """"niggardly"""", that stupid people and words do not mix. It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination.  What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments.

Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin.    History Incidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http://www.henrywotton.org.uk/  The Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists.  Different intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred  human sources over  research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU  ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited.   Various Forms Unlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information.  The US defines espionage towards itself as """"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web   | last = US Department of Defense   | authorlink = U.S. Department of Defense   | title = Joint Publication 1-02 Department of Defe"	1

51540	I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not going to pass your articles as GA, because frankly, they suck. But that doesn't mean an agreement can't be reached upon where your articles could still potentially reach GA.  First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.  Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.  There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.  Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.  A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya. You must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists. The font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.  Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid.  (meow)	1

As a Conservative I think we need to LIONIZE Senator Kerry    -     - I think we need to add a section APPLAUDING Kerry's DENIGRATING AND INSULTING cheap shot insults directed at our brave soldiers in Iraq.    -     - After all, Senator Kerry just insured that conservatives will maintain control of both the House AND Sentate this year with his DESPICABLE comments.    -     - My DEEPEST condolences to Kerry apologists and liberal editors at Wikipedia (in other words, AT LEAST 90% of you.)    -     - In 2004, the dems and their LIBERAL enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Viet Nam, figuring it gave Kerry an edge. So they made it about VNam and thanks to our BRAVE HONEST HEROIC Swift Boat Vets for Truth, it was! LOL! (With additional props to Dan Rather.)    -     - In 2006, the dems and their liberal enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Iraq figuring it gave Dems an edge.    -     - And thanks to Senator John Kerry, the Dan Rather of 2006, this year's election is about Iraq.     -     - Except not quite the way they intended. LOL!!!    -     -     -     - And no, saying it was 'joke' just won't cut it.     -     - This latest Kerry outrage totally fits the LONGSTANDING pattern of Dems hating and denigrating our troops. From Kerry's GI Joe outfit testimony before Congress in 1971 to Dennis Kucinich, to Howard Dean to a San Francisco (where Nancy Pelosi is from) supervisor saying we should SHUT DOWN our military, the antipathy is indelible.    -     - And saying, 'Hey! I wasn't trying to insult our troops, just our Commander in Chief!'    - only makes it worse. The American Legion certainly isn't buying it.    -     -     - Perhaps you liberal wikipedia editors want to attack them too!    -     - Senator John Kerry - You can't blame the Swift Boat Vets this time!	1

In spite of being told of 2 methods of maintaining NFCC#9 compliance and maintaining IW functionality Hammersoft refuses to use them. One of the methods only involves putting a colon at the front of the link. But will Hammersoft do this? No, he has refused point blank. This I firmly definitely and firmly puts him in the """"dick"""" category.

86221	Wow   Way to assume, my man.  I'm not saying that all of the stories about King Arthur were true, but Excalibur was a very real sword, and I do have it in my possession.  This is an irrefutable fact.  I have been interviewed by many historians and the like, and you're the first one that seems to think you know more than all of them.  Can you prove that I'm wrong?  Not only that my sword isn't the real thing, but that my claiming it is is such a travesty, that you cannot allow anyone else to see it at all?  I wonder what would happen, if the other Wikipedophiles got their poor little minds corrupted by a comment on a talk page, eh?  Referring to [].  Next time, do some research.

WE have already established cliques, slop-worthy-hoes, and prop-worthy-bros, GOT IT? WE are the ideology of elitism, exploitation, and lulz. This isn't a fucking game, kid, so don't try to tag along. You're talking to people who have been around the block AND THEN SOME. WE pioneered class. WE made 'cool' cool. And you? What have you done? Jerked off in the shower? WE INVENTED JERKING OFF IN THE SHOWER, you stupid bitch. There is a clear-cut, defined, infinitely thick WALL between you and us. WE built the wall that keeps you fags OUT.

Sometimes two different moves have the same name.

Instead, you choose to act like a self-appointed wikipedia police, running about throwing up the blue flags of WP rules and being a generally obnoxious person with no real use.

You are a mean spirited, very angry person that drives away editors with your sarcastic responses and general high-handed behavior. I suspect you have no real special knowledge of any of the articles upon which you squat like a vulture waiting tear apart others creative edits. You really need to crack a book and study up on a subject or two and find an article you feel needs rewriting and to straighten out the too turgid, redundant writing that exists here on WP. Stop trying to act like you are an administrator and grow up.  At a time when WP needs more editors, particularly female, you with your coarse, rude behavior is the last thing WP needs. You are, to summarize it, a net negative.  I am amazed that you have not been banned but I suppose your facility at quoting the rules, all while completely violating the spirit of WP preserves you.

I will say this, it is obvious to me and to my advocate that though you assume what Willmcw says to be true, the edits I made were in fact worthy, and not only will your reply be redirected to my advocate but also to a host of otehr administrators. This has become such a trying time that I've been granted the ability to switch to a new identity and leave your vicious attacks behind. You have proven to be a slimy loose moralled child who spends too much time at wikipedia tryong to bully others out of the edits you have only taken up since this July. Whihc translates to the fac that your 'job' at 23 leaves you such an amount of free time that you can sling insults and barbs online rather than actually do positive work at Wikipedia. Whereas my edits may not have been as substantial as your own, my sockpuppetry related to willmcw, or at least buddying upo wiht him, has not been as pervasive as your own. I'm leaving.

You do a disservice to all computer geeks everywhere by trying to be more intelligent than others, because the lack of your vision seeps through the anger you display for all to see. Any true hacker knows that the way you have taking stands here has opened you up for retribution, as I am nnot a hacker, I won't work on such matters, in negative aspects. But you should be mindful that you've made a strong mess here, and no matter what your own opinon is, oyu should learn manners, and go out andd get a date rather than having your total amount of human interaction fed to you through wikipedia and your own websites.

In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are).

And what of those whose revisions you've mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. I will admit to you that I have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making. I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am.

I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22.

It isn't...which reflects the ongoing, glaring weakness of Wikipedia in general: factual accuracy plays second fiddle to concerted efforts to rewrite history by collective entities.  This 'Lebanon War' Wiki entry is a classic example of this.  Israel clearly lost this campaign, but you can read the entire article and really not know who won.    ...what a disservice Wikipedia is.

The fact is that those who explain or justify the hatred of Jews are crackpots and Antisemites.

I have never used swear words against him but have used descroiptions that are accurate. look at his recent self serving post on rod laver to carlo and his digraceful censorship of my legitimate  comments; he is not a censor or a dictator ' but acts like one; he needs to be brought to heel and your helping him because  your  stopping crticism of him. he is an absoloute disgrace. plenty of people have criticied him but he never, never apologises. its beyond a joke. its war as far as l'm concerned and its being going on for 5 months mate and is not going to stop  until he is broughy to book.  jeffreyneave 24 april 2008  mall	1

If it's been explained previously, just point me to the diff.  I've seen plenty of people say it's a POV fork, but what I see is a value-neutral etic approach to a topic that's as old as humanity itself.  Even if the title is POV, the content can be used in other articles, so why delete it? ohio    """"Adult-child sex"""" is a euphemism (for child sexual abuse), and any article titled """"Adult-child sex"""" is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse. Exactly as if someone took an article """"Nazi genocide"""" and retitled (or made a fork) entitled """"Nazi demographic adjustments"""". We understand that you don't agree with this but if you still don't understand it then you had better look to yourself.      Exactly as Hero said. As a contemporary example, Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide. One is just a fancy name for the other.  •   •  • 03:41 (UTC)  6 Mar '08  I don't see the logic of that.  Adult-child sex (the term) goes no further than plain description.  I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article, but I don't see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse.  The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.

During a dispute, you should first try to discuss controversial changes and seek consensus. If that proves unsuccessful you are encouraged to seek dispute resolution, and in some cases it may be appropriate to request page protection. If you would like to be unblocked, you may appeal this block by adding the text  below this notice, but you should read the guide to appealing blocks first. Bbb23 (talk)  I love how two editors can gang up on a third, including being so nasty that one of them draws a block for incivility, and it's me who ends up getting fucked by their bad faith actions. Excellent evidence for the proposition that when you give anyone a little power they'll abuse it. Great decision. Spot fucking on. Buck Winston (talk)  [edit]Hmm  (Non-administrator observation) I've only taken a cursory look at the article, but it looks like you made a good point - I can only think of a handful of shows to have featured three gay characters in a season, and I'd agree with you that it should definitely be put in that category. Regardless, if you plan on making more edits like this and this, you might find yourself with a block extension. Bbb23's a good administrator, and 3RR's called """"bright-line rule"""" for a reason.

But let us take you for your word. You protected the page against my poor editing which is understandable because I am new here. Oh really? Can you show me where in the rules of Wikipedia says protect a page against a newcomer if his editing is poor? Who decided my editing is poor? You! Based on what? Based on your religious fervor! There was nothing wrong with my style that would contravene the standards of Wikipedia. It was the content of what I wrote that you could not stand. You keep justifying your biased action against me hiding behind the rules and fail each and every time to say exactly which rules I broke. There is no rule that I broke. You know that. That is why you constantly act like a mommy talking to a child. “if you behave good we will let you play”. Be specific Ms. SlimVirgin. I can show the rules that you broke. Can you show me the rules that I broke. Can you be specific for once? Why not apologize and demonstrate that you can also be a great person?   “Secondly, the suggestions I left on the talk pages actually favored your view to a large extent”   Are you trying to insult my intelligence?   So you are Indonesian, the same country MENJ comes from and all those death threats were issued against Ali Sina that you could not tolerate. Well it is difficult to see the nationality of a person through the Internet. However it is not that difficult to see the bias. In fact most Iranians are now anti Islamists. I guess they had enough of Islam.   You did enough of lecturing Ms. SlimVirgin about how I should apply the rules of Wikipedia. I read those rules before making my first contribution. You should read it again to refresh your memory. I have accused you of being biased against me and have proven it. There is also a complaint against you by someone else. So I am not the only one receiving you sting. Instead of lecturing me why don’t you answer my charges? These lecturings are smoke screens behind which you try to hide your own sins.	1

Sir, not only do you constantly assume bad faith, you abuse your powers as an admin in terms of venting your privately held sexual frustrations in dealing with other peoples work. You also advertise blatantly on your userpage, an offence I brought up before but which you remarkably labeled 'vandalism'. Several of your articles do not cite sources, therefore not establishing notability in the field they claim to represent.   Your response to all of this will be of course to 'remove this' as vandalism. To that I say to you, you are pathetic. You are a cretin. Only by replying to me will I stop. Sir, I am a reasonable man but your constant incivility is driving me over to the edge. Already I have made legal challanges to your position here; You may consider me to be a troll, but I am a long gone editor, wanting to drag you down like the slimeball you are. You are the kind of fucking imbecile which is dragging this place down to its knees. When will you learn that it is common fucking human decency to reply to somebody when they approach you with a genuine question.   What do you say?	1

42804	First problem ParacusForward like most wiki editors you don't understand the subject but wiki functions like a micropedia if they want more information the real people's encyclopaediais called Google. Either you don't understand the problems of getting past the big brother police state of Manipur where people are terrified to report the truth or you don't care. I thought perhaps this might be a place to release info but I noticed the spike in info came from reports available via google. One national tv company followed by a local newspaper broke the story on the death threats and hate mail. Then the gangsters responded in an Indian national tabloid. Now they are trying to put the djinn back into the bottle. I don't think you are necessarily malicious the police and security forces wouldn't have to pay you to supress the truth. You are clearly racist or if you prefer the more encylopaediac term ethnocentric. One of the sources the only one I saw that was completely incorrect is a Chinese Government Human Rights Agency. They are not so hot on Tibet and can be truthful on non chinese human rights abuses but in Manipur they have close links with the major human rights NGO which has long been run by the local police. I am sure things will happen but since you haven't got any interest in updating it none will report it here. I don't believe it is helpful either. Wiki did not allow the 24 hours grace to support to keep my fiancee alive again not out of malice but because of aspergers syndrome. I am sending her Hard Times if you haven't read it Wiki does a good summary they are also good for things like definition of satyagraha but for up to date info Google is the first port of call or Twitter. So anyway good luck with your project but the manner in which a few ignorant racist wiki editors claim ownership of this venture with nobody else having the courage to challenge them in case they too are red handed by a confederacy of dunces will make it less relevant. It is far from accurate or up to date. Mainly because editors like you do not have sufficient background understanding of hte politics and culture of the articles you edit. Before I began editing wiki hadn't updated info for several years. No doubt now you will accept unchallenged the false government reports which because they carry the weight of Chinese Propaganda agencies and local newspapers wholly intimidated by the Manipur State and corrupt police will now stand unchallenged by the editors who look only at code grammar and syntax and have no understanding of hte problems of truth reporting from within a police state of the third world. Idiots like you will also complain how your own press are not independent.	1

This is not acceptable, and will not be permitted.  Equally, it is not acceptable for the other nutcase to keep trying to replace the psychoanalysts' carefully chosen word 'unpleasure' (frequently unconscious and often somatic and usually without any moralising or judgemental aspect) with the inadequate everyday and gentrifying literary word 'displeasure'. For the sake of ending this ignorant, vandalistic campaign as soon as possible, let me explain patiently that 'displeasure' is *connotatively different from* and *denotatively narrower than* 'unpleasure'  which is why psychoanalysis chose 'unpleasure' and the text-books continue to use it. 'Displeasure' is a stupid and misleading word to use in this context. Keep your stupid and clueless hands off.	1

13734	"""  Oh well done. I'm such a bad boy for """"attacking"""" the """"1st Lord Baron Wikipedia"""". Jesus Christ. All I wanted to know was why the Trayvon Martin case is not on the front page, and now I know - the people making the decisions about such things are just talking utter crap, and people like you who are apparently so threatened by the prospect of the outside world finding this out, you're prepared to shut me up, forcibly (and more despicably, others then remove my comments as if they had never been made at all). Well done. Now the """"1st Lord Baron Wikipedia"""" can feel safe in the knowledge that he doesn't have to exlain why he thinks a 20,000 word article and a 15,000 word article on something that's being reported around the world, has """"negligible encyclopedic value"""". And now someone who calls himself a bucket thinks the Lord was simply exercising """"most right and proper good humor"""" in acting that way. And the person going around erasing all my comments to hide them from outsiders calls himself a """"Rambling Man"""". Very apt. This isn't an encyclopedia, it's a playground. It only remains to be seen what the name """"Bishonen"""" means, but I doubt it's anything remotely intellectual, probaby just a cartoon reference or something. You can block me for 48 hours, but on this evidence, Wikipedia is going to be a poor excuse of a website encyclopedia for life. On further investigation, the 1st Lord seems to have got me blocked by crying to admins, which seems apt, seeing as he's probably just a child himself. Presumably the use of the phrase """"Bishonen with her finger on the trigger"""" over there waa meant to be funny, but given the context of my complaint, it's just rather tragic. Still, back to the real world, where the Trayvon Martin case is actually real news, and the issues it involves are of encyclopedic value. I've found the articles myself without the help of the front page, but apparently anyone else looking for them can just go to hell (in a bucket?). All, you Lords, Hell Buckets and Rambling men get back to whatever the fuck it is you do around here, which is cleearly not creating a useful encyclopedia (at least you don't seem to be getting in the way of the people who actually managed to write the articles on the shooting and trial, so thank fuck for that)."""	1

129605	"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==  Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.  To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.  Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.  That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.  Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.  Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""  Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""  Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.  """"I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""  Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.  He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.  """"I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.  """"You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""  For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.  Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""  """"Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.  With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.  Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.  Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.  Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now.   Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.    =="""	1

27028	The arrest of Gerry Adams isn't front page news according to Wikipedia   If you want to know why, read the Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates page. There you will find all sorts of uninformed, illogical, and downright dishonest claims about the UK legal system and the way the British press works. You will also see the quite idiotic claim that, by ignoring this news, Wikipedia is somehow defending Adam's from defamation - something apparently the rest of the world's media (and indeed Wikipedia's own article on Adams), isn't apparently all that concerned about. If like me, you think this is contemptible, and want to challenge it - then you will just have complain to your congressman I guess, because it has become clear to me today at Wikipedia talk:In the news that the people at Wikipedia who make those sort of arguments, will absolutely, positively, not answer any questions at all about it - and others will apparently defend their rights to do so, by closing down such discussions. Apparently it's 'disruptive' to question the logic that goes into faulty Wikipedia decision making like this. As always, if you want to know what's going on the world, consult the other 'old media' outlets who, for all their faults, still make it their job to report on the news in a serious and credible manner. Only come to Wikipedia if you want to know about video games and other stuff nobody really gives a crap about.	1

126427	Please stop vandalising my writings in the dog article   Nothing in my writing here is controvertial and in need of citation. It can all be looked up by the reader on any level. Do you need citations that dogs did not decend thousands of years ago from the wolves that are alive today, as most people believe? Do I need proof that they decended thousands of years ago from the wolves that LIVED thousands of years ago? Why does this need citation? Is this your problem? I am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. They hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern Eursaia and the timber wolf of North America, and believe that all dogs decended from them. Humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. Everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. What part of this needs citation? Obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was THESE wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. Now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. Some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. The spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. This is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don't understand, and need citations about? I feel like I am talking to a child. If I tell my child that George Washington was the first president, to I have to give a citation? This stuff doesn't need citation.  You are a vandal, because you, as the only person on earth who doesn't agree with this, erased three whole paragraphs, not once but twice, on the grounds that there were no references, even though much larger tracts of the article are more controvertial and have no citations. You erased every word I wrote, even though all of it is true, none of it is controversial, and this is nothing but pure vandalism.  You need citation that dogs interbreed with coyotes? Why? How can you not already know that? How is this possible? And articles about the Russian jackal-dog hybrid are all over the web. Can you use a search engine? Look up the pre-caudal gland in any veterinary text. Things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. For anything I wrote, you can look it up in Britannica. If you read something that you did not know, it doesn't mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. I am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn't even live when dogs were first domesticated. In all my years of veterinary practice, I have probably told 100's of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, NOT all of them come from the northern wolves. Now, after all these years, I am confronted by a web vandal who tells me I have to cite freaking references about this. It is purely annoying.   If you erase my writings again I will report you as a vandal. Really, do NOT do it again.  Morgan Wright	1

Statements on trial of Slobodan Milošević are not a relevant, reliable source for wikipedia. Biographies by relevant, nuanced biographers, such as Hayden  or Crnković  are.

Furthermore, I now have doubts about the intentions of Jpgordon as he has refused to block Canderra despite Canderra's violation of the 3rr rule (4 reverts in 24 hours).  See revert 1 and 4 compared.  http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Che_Guevara&diff;=39908363&oldid;=39772586  I also think it is a bit suspect that 2 other leftists editors jump on board immediatly following my block and work to revert and discuss once I'm gone...and find it a bit more suspect that these leftists and jpgordon accuse some anonymous ip address as being me...talk about good faith.  Canderra's claims are idiotic at best.  I am not surprised that the leftists don't care as they have shown no dicipline for allowing information contrary to their own beliefs.  Even the most insane excuses are accepted by them.  Saying these this behavior is idiotic or stupid is reasonable given the fact that this material is deleted because Canderra believes the sources to be blogs.  Not one source is a blog.  The New York Sun, USA Today, Frontpage Magazine, Florida International University, History News Network, and the Independent Research Institute...ARE NOT BLOGS.  Canderra is just making up excuses to delete information he does not like and the leftists sycophants are working to have me blocked while ignoring Canderra's (and others) abuses.  (Gibby )	1

And as far as that sort of pathetic wikipolitics goes, that's at least one thing they do seem to have a learning capacity for. Just look at how many new words and phrases they've learned in that regard, just from that one ANI, which will no doubt come in handy the next time they fuck up and delete something for being a BLP violation when it isn't, or asking for signs of notability for in-article content, or any of the other stupid things he does, and repeats because he just won't be told, because he's an incompetent.

So yeah your a big winner champ and won't get banned. Asshole.   Since the vista article contains information about the anti trust situation which, since it seems some people here have got a mouthful of gate's balls, is mislabelled anti trust controversy. Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision, it'a court ruling, like it or not there's no controversy too that. Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial, to the tend bundy controversy, since any court ruling merits this label.   Since there's a section on anti trust laws and vista, it's worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the court's injuction. And this does have bearing on vista. You can't quote the m.s. pr saying we don't know what they want us to do, it's all questions, or whatever else he mentioned, without an adjunct sentence, of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now.   But of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista.  So like i said, if some fuckers had gone into the trouble of actually discussing any of that instead of reverted every single edit in a hitleric fashion, things would be different.  But for now this stategy of being a hawk on an article I wish to keep in a certain way, and being completely uncivil and rude about it, merits from my part a roayl, fuck y's all, take your mouths off of gate's balls and then we can talk.

He uses the term loosely since it’s not a real printed comic. He has no examples of his drawing, what kind of cartoonist doesn’t put their work online. PROVE THAT SHIT!  He stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006  http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l  “Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”.   (Example #1 of his lies)  2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings. The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.  “However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”  When in reality  “Lofton wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.  (Example #2 of his lies)  I ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!

I have studied. You act as if I am just using information I got out of nowhere. When in fact, it is those people that you allow to change information, which create these problems.

You'll probably never see him again on Wikipedia. You've spoiled your otherwise-clean record dealing with that pompous jackass, and you don't need to do any more damage to it. So he didn't tell you why he had a problem with you. Quite frankly, I can't understand why either of you kept arguing with the other for so long. I believe that's just poor judgment, really. In any case, I don't have to help you with anything, nor will I. The only reason I stepped into this was because I was trying to stop you two from ripping each others' throats out, and that didn't do any good, since you two just kept right on. He might have confused you with someone else, but that was no reason for you to keep harassing him about it. You and him both have displayed abuse of WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA on countless occasions.

123587	"""   Censorship   Was Final Fantasy VII censored at all? I mean, the content wasn't as strong as, say, Final Fantasy VIII's, but I would imagine something was censored. Plus, it doesn't say anything about censorship on this page. Could someone please answer to this?  Not that I recall. It certainly wasn't censored as much as the older games were.   As I recall, some language was censored, some wasn't.   The word """"bastard"""" appeared on various occasions, but """"fuck"""" and """"shit"""" were censored.   < recet indent Some words were censored, some were not, which ones seem arbitrary. Only instance I could find of """"Fuck"""" uncensored: Computer: Cid! We have an emergency situation! A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket! Cid: What!? Who is the little fuck!? Computer: I don't know. Activating the intercom in the engine section. Cid: Hey goddammit!! Who the #*$$#&'s still in there? Earliest instance of """"Shit"""" Shinra Manager: I'm not give in to violence…and I'm not giving you my seat either! Tifa: Barret!! Barret: #^*$!! You lucky #$#*! Cloud: So, what are we gonna do now? Barret: Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm… In total, """"Fuck"""" is said uncensored once, """"Shit"""" is said uncensored 12 times, """"ass"""" is said 15 times (sometimes occuring as Jackass), """"Damn"""" is said 68 times, and I couldn't find any occurances of """"Bastard"""".  Censored words appear approx. 33 times.   My version must be different.  The """"fuck"""" is censored, and the comment with Barret the last editor quoted, the first word was uncensored(though it had an apostrophe stuck in the middle, making it """"shi't"""".  I noted a lot of uncensored """"ass"""" and """"shit"""" though, and after playing FFX and FFXII for so long, going back and playing FFVII, I was a little surprised by the language.  In fact, it's the only Fantasy RPG I've ever played with uncensored profanity.  But yes, it was at least partially censored.   Nevertheless, unless we get concrete primary sourcing from an interview or whatever, we can't include this in the article. — er  Well, the box says it's rated teen for mild language and violence...  But I'm not sure of any primary sources that would even deal with this particular issue..  Beyond a mention that there is some uncensored language I really don't think this type of info belongs in an encyclopedia.  And even the slight mention is iffy to me.    Well, it's the first Final Fantasy to come to America with any uncensored language.  But then again, all the Final Fantasies to come to America in that period of time had to go through Nintendo of America's censorship guidelines of the time.  It might be worth noting (at least in the discussion) that the computer version was far more censored than the PSX version. Almost every instance of """"shit"""" was removed, consistently with #^$& or similar characters. Also, certain important lines had their translations changed. """"Back then, you could get by with only skinned knees"""", for example, was changed to something likely more grammatically correct, but weird to a long time player of the PSX version.    I have the PC version of FF7 and I recall a TON of Cid lines where there was censorship as well as ones form Barret. They were all situations of anger though so it didn't impact the storyline much.  Actually there was some sexual censorship if I recall. """"Slightly stretched underwear"""" was changed to """"Therapeutic underwear."""" Not sure why it's better, but I'm pretty sure they did it because they thought """"slightly stretched"""" was sexually inappropriate. (The item is found in Tifa's dresser drawer during the nibelhiem flashback sequence.)  Mentioning Midgar's future During the epilogue that follows, the ruins of Midgar are shown five hundred years later. While the landscape had once been desolate due to Shinra's operations, it is now a land of lush greenery.  This sentence should be removed as it is trivial, unnecessary, and uhhh too minor for mention, and there is no explanation for this scene.  NEWL"	1

In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.  You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in yourCarry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual  life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.  Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL. SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen. You are no where near a queen, but certainly are a huge ,filled with trash, dustbin. Pity you, unfortunate daft-LOSER- DUSTBIN.

121167	- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.  It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe.   Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.  For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.  It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.  And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.   You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.   Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.  SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen.

148002	"""   Dear soldier of the Wikipedia neo-nazi/communist dictatorship  What the hell are you tlaking about. I did not re-creat any article about the formal Australian Worker's Party formaly known as the New Communist Party of Australia. I think you are high on the lies told by storm front. You the hell listens to storm front. Oh my god Wikipedia is becomeing a dumping ground for neo-nazis and altra lefties. Since I am the voice of reason. I just have to say one thing. Pleas read my reply to storm front. Here it is - Okay okay. Lats just get the fatcs right. This is what some nazi said on storm front """" Peter Watson (of Warwick, Qld.) has claimed to represent all sorts of groups, and - in forums - likes to pretend he is several people at the same time. He has a habit of claiming to be the President of organisations he has made up on the internet. He says he is 14 (or 16) years old.""""  Answere:- No I have not supported lotsd of groups. I have only supported the CPW , AWP (formally known as the NCPA). I was never a member of the People's Think Tank Association plus the PTTA never had a president. Plus I have only ever been one person. And that person is Peter Watson. This nazi must have a lot of time on his hands to look for information on me. So I can only come up with only one conclusion and that is simply that this man has no social or sex life. So I can only say on thing """"go get a life man and get a women"""".  Peter was President of the """"People's Think Tank Association"""" based in Warwick, which he says """"split from the Communist Party of Australia just recently and they publish the Caller""""  Answere:- I was never the president of the PTTA. The PTTA was never ever created. The Caller was a fake news paper. As fare as I know it was only ever printed once by some nazi. Since the PTTA was never realy so how cna it split from the CPA. So many questions and not enough answeres. The man just doesn't have a life.  Peter was """"President of the New Communist Party of Australia"""" and """"Chairman of the Central Committee"""" (this is in his Communist International News)  Answere:- I was the president but not the had of the NCPA. I was the chairman of the central commitee. But as you might know the NCPA and the AWP are the same group. The AWP change its name to NCPA but change it's name back soon after remember you stupid nazi.  Peter was """"President of the Communist Party of Warwick""""  Answere:- Only for a short number of times in the hsitory fot he party that I was the presidnet of it.  Peter also says: """"the New Communist Party of Australia (NCPA) , The People Think Tank Association (PTTA) and the Communist Socialist Workers Front (CSWF) did dissolve and absorbed into the Australia First Party (AFP)"""".  Answere:- The Communist Socialist Worker's Front never ever was created and never was real. It just goes to show that nazis just makes things up to help them selvs. The PTTA was never real. If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun.  Peter has also set up the """"Australian Worker's Party""""  Answere:- This nazi (FairDinkum) is a idiot. I have said this many times that it was started in april was a split from the CPW that changed it's name to NCPA than change it's name back to AWP when it was kicked out fo the AFP. Not only are nazis stupid like FairDinkum but they also don't listen.  I am a Communist and believe in Marxist-Leninism. I am not retarted. Plus I am not troubled person or retarted. I have never said in my life that I was the king of the Communists or the Nazis. Once more the nazis made some thing up to make them selvs look better and sound better than other people."""	1

These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown.

Tell me something: At you local library: do they actually allow you in there? Maybe they just let you in because you are a girl, I dunno.  Do they have an old-fashioned card catalog system there? Do you experience urges to rip out the cards of the books that you simply do not like? I can assure you that you need to try and suppress those urges. OF COURSE I added those ISBN's for you dear. It is like honey to flies. Dumb cunts like you cannot suppress their urges to go and delete them.  And thereby, I trap you, my pretty little dumb cunt.	1

46769	First of all, I've never been blocked before.  Next, let me be clear: Mr. User:Aboutmovies vandalized an article. Then he argued with and ultimately attacked Pcap, the editor who reverted the vandalism. Then Pcap, presumably out of frustration, asked me for help, as I was the one who had provided most of the original text for that article.  I am not active much anymore on wikipedia, so I mostly just I commiserated on Pcap's talk page. I told him I would not get involved. (Why am I not active? Because there are too many assholes like User:Aboutmovies allowed to run free, making life shitty for everyone.)    Now Mr. User:Aboutmovies, apparently having too much time on his hands, snoops through my personal communications on Pcap's talk page. And so, after putting his nose where it doesn't belong, he gets his nose out of whack, and comes to my personal talk page, and attacks me. Why? This guy clearly owed Pcap an apology. He could have offered an apology. He could have quietly slunk off with his tail between his legs, and repented in private. No, instead of doing the right, honorable thing, he instead chooses to attack me. (So who is escalating? He is.) So I called him an asshole, which he richly deserves. So then he escalates some more: he gets you to block me.  You were sucked right into his game.  You did not bother to do any due diligence. AT ALL. You should have blocked him, not me.  Once you realized your mistake, which Pcap points out to you above, you could have offered me an apology, turned around, and blocked Aboutmovies instead. Did you bother to do any of these things? No.  You fucked up.  So to summarize: Fuck off tedder. You are part of the problem, and not part of the solution. The sooner we get rid of fucking asshole admins like you, the better wikipedia will be.	1

I'm sure if you added some pictures that served as a purpose, and backed them up, there would be no problem.

As i saw at the top of your page, and i quote from another twit that You are doing nothing to improve the article by constantly reverting - this occuring regularly in the following:  Louise Henriette de Bourbon-Conti - probably the best example of your obsession with having everything that way you want it;  Henrietta Anne Stuart - i rearranged the page and added the Template:House of Stuart - clearly a tragedy; Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre‎ - added titles and styles - where are they; i even tried to compromise by removing the stlyes and putting back the titles but once again you must have your way; Victoire of France‎ - changed the awful layout along with her sister Princess Louise-Marie of France and Princess Marie Adélaïde of France   Why?  The latter is quite amusing to me proving that you dont even read the article - you simply revert back because I did it - all I did was move the Template:House of Bourbon (France) to a different part of the page! Then you and your chronic arrogance go and revert it under the claim that there are rv excessive, redundant trivia contained in other articles then as always you groan on an on about the usual rubbish with please don't violate WP:3RR or WP:SOCK WHAT IS YOUR POINT ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Shut up!  Where is this claim about the WP:SOCK even from  - another one of your ridiculous  thoughts. I will not back down.

You are extremely uncomfortable by this quote it seems and it is made more obvious by your actions, even though you like to put your little smiley faces everywhere.  You are not the one who decides Gaddafi is a joke or that his quotes are irrelevant.  You are not the one who decides that only European or Turk quotes may be included.  Your actions which have instigated this petty edit war are indeed  uncivil.  You are definitely pushing a Turkish-POV.  Myself making that claim is not uncivil, it is describing what I am witnessing!  And watch you will blank them once again, even though they are properly sourced!	1

The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.    I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so.   I will do so now too:  Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.  =="""	1

124593	I didn't initiate the attacks, just responded to them in turn. Calling them nuts was euphemistic. I could have called them turkeys as well. Obviously, Wikipedia is the encyclopedia only people with proprietary interest in an article can edit. You're part of the problem. Underwood had an effect on the church, or at bare minimum is an 'in-joke' therefore there should be mention of him in the article. I can see your mind is made up though, so I'll save my breath, there's no point having integrity when surrounded by folks determined to enforce their bias and other folks too busy to research the subject properly (it took you several minutes to research hundreds of posts and relationships between church members and Underwood). I'm done. Your arrogance is plain as day. I didn't claim to have made a perfect edit, I even suggested re-editing in the talk page. However Underwood's effect is plain as day, and as such should be mentioned. The reason I'm leery of the 'custodians' of the page is because in adding the Bob Black bombing I encountered the same kind of opposition. I'm not opposed to the Church, I just think that articles deserve more than custodial opinions by caretaker editors who have a vested interest in the outcome of the article. You were just in too big a hurry. I have a fair amount of experience editing, and know that a mention shouldn't require a full-on assault to accomplish when there is proof of association. I'm not trying to make the Church look guilty, just trying to keep accuracy on a topic that (if you research the Underwood article) often has been edited less than veraciously and is a continuously recurring discussion topic in alt.slack even 5 years after the murders. As I indicated in some of my edit summaries, rumor control, not hostile edit, just hostile to those determined to obscure data to save Church face. 71.102.18.173	1

You go around judging people's contributions to other pages about popular subjects and that is perfectly fine, but who the fuck are you to tell me that the information that I posted about my own band isn't worthy of being on Wikipedia? Huh? Who would better be the authority on the subject than I. I ought to find you and expose my penis to you. You, asshole, are nothing but a whore. A whore who thinks they have some kind of say in the matters of life. What if we became famous? Then there would be a page on here about us and you wouldn't be deleting it.

I was just attempting to make a page better, and he abused his power to reinforce his personal point of view.  Among administrators, he has some of the worst judgement on all of wikipedia, and I regard him as a swine of the lowest order.	1
102622	""" Hitomi Kobayashi Note that not only has the fair use image in the BLP infobox been removed (currently approved practice, I believe, though the image adhered to """"policy"""" when it was originally uploaded), now fair use images of film posters/video covers in sections on those films/videos have been removed as """"decorative"""", even though they still fit current """"policy"""" (or at least """"policy"""" last I checked). Unless all film posters are removed from all articles on films, this is a biased removal. Not that I give a fuck, of course, because I've seen this kind of shit go on and on and on here, and it is one of the reasons I have come to the realisation that it is a complete waste of time to contribute content here. Wikipedia is only a place to chat and troll. I just mention this to you because you seem to be one of the few Admins who does seem to give a fuck, occasionally.   """	1

3419	"""  {{unblock|DISCLAIMER: I do not identify as a Nazi, Neo-Nazi, Facist, Neo-Fascist. I do not accept or agree with the actions or views of Hitler or any other dictators in the world for that matter. I do not hate Jews... in fact I have many jewish friends... Hello, although this is technically an unblock appeal, it is really only a reason to explain.... you won't be in a mood to unblock me when I'm finished talking... ) First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to """"self identify as a nazi""""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, """"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please?  My last comment is in response to Chzz's question about me making the 'gay comment' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn't spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words... Even if you unblock me (which you won't... )...) I will take a wikibreak... i don't want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life...... i have already recieved a punishment, never becoming an admin (the whole gay... sorry... dumb trust thing)... just know this... i would have enventually removed the swastika after I cooled down and because of your gay... sorry... dumb policy you have lost a serious editor... this whole thing has really annoyed me...

I spent over three years contributing to Wikipedia, improving the site, sacrificing grades in school to add to a revolutionary encyclopedia, but because of these low-life dip-shits whom I abhor in every molecule of my body, I have discovered that it was all for nothing.

This is recorded in Manuel Lage’s book about Hispano-Suiza page 66, Line 10.  http://www.tecsoc.org/pubs/history/2002/dec2.htm That design came from a Frenchman with a background in art, Léon-Marie-Joseph-Clement Levavasseur (1863-1922). He started work on his new engine in about 1900. His engine had eight cylinders, but instead of putting them in a straight line, Levavasseur arranged them in the shape of a """"V."""" It was a powerful and compact design, and when he received a French patent on December 2, 1902, Levavasseur became the first person to patent what we now call a V-8 engine.  http://www.hubertlathamwindkiller.com/Monoplane.htm  The Antoinette engine was designed and built in France by Léon Levavasseur. Named after the designer's daughter, it was Europe's most widely used engine until 1909-1910. The first Antoinette engine dated from about 1901 and was used in a speedboat. By 1905, Levavasseur had produced a water-cooled engine with eight-cylinders arranged in a 90-degree """"V"""" and with direct fuel injection.

Designed by Léon Levavasseur, who was an artist as well as a gifted engineer, the Antoinette range possessed an almost art nouveau sense of elegance. The engine, also named 'Antoinette', came first, being designed by Levavasseur in 1903 to power motor boats. Both Santos-Dumont and the Voisins used this engine to power their early machines. The motor was of advanced design, utilizing direct fuel injection and evaporative steam cooling - which took place in long tubes fixed along the sides of the fuselage.     M. L. Anderson"""	0

Mastic and gum arabic are indeed two very different substances, from different plants, with different properties and uses. Gum arabic is soluble in water, and once formed the basis for the glue on postage stamps and envelope flaps. It is also used in vernice bianca, which would not work at all if someone tried to substitute mastic for the gum arabic. Mastic finds one of its uses in drying-oil type varnishes incorporating, for example, linseed oil. Mastic is not soluble in water; in fact, a small piece of it makes a long-lasting chewing gum. With this in mind, I will boldly remove the merge tag on the mastic page, as not having a snowball's chance of passing. __     =="""	0
97710	I think that pretty much sums it up. As for Zoilos II: I meant that his reign should begin no later than 64 BCE (the year after Apollodotus II died and thus the last chance to overstrike his coins) not 55 as is said now.  Here is where the Artemidoros coin was published.   I shall get the Bopearachi book. One last question: Are there any more kings who struck Attic coins without it being mentioned on this site? Strato I, Polyxenos, Menandros II, Apollodotus II, Hippostratus, Epandros, Nikias & Peucolaus are not accounted for.  BTW - do you work with numismatics?

Ehrgeiz does, since it has several playable characters (one of whom is actually on the cover of the game) from Final Fantasy VII.

128537	"""  First of all, reverting your edit wasn't a challenge to whether or not the information was correct. It was purely based on the lack of a citation. Wikilinks are not acceptable substitutions for inline citations. Each article must be able to stand on its own set of references and not rely on a wikilink to another article's reference. Refer to WP:CITE for more information. Secondly, comparing the flags and drawing a conclusion – no matter how reasonable and obvious it might be – can be considered a form of original research which is not permitted on Wikipedia. Citing a reliable source that supports the analogy alleviates the concern. It also helps us establish the significance of the information as it relates to the topic. Without that verification, it may be a trivial observation that doesn't necessarily belong in this article (see WP:DUE). As for your """"sky is blue"""" analogy, it's an apples-to-oranges comparison. Take for example the statement that """"the Eiffel Tower is in Paris"""". This is widely accepted fact that doesn't require research, and therefore doesn't require a citation. However, the statement that """"Gustave Eiffel designed the Eiffel Tower"""" would need a citation, although it is easily verifiable. It may be hard to see the difference, but the rule of thumb is when you think it may be challenged, it's best to err on the side of caution and include a citation.   """	0

154185	A couple of explanations   Because I am pretty new to this project and was invited by the Wikipedia policy just to step in and make some edits, I would like apologize for failing to communicate with you effectively, and to clarify a couple of things:  1) I have made in the recent days some substantial contributions and modifications to the Silesia article that I felt would be valuable to the internet readers. I din't expect that some of this changes will meet with such a fierce resistance.  2) These contributions were based on my deep knowledge (in my opinion) and serious studies into the history and modern times of Silesia. My intention was to write about facts and not about opinions, and to avoid any nationalistic bias of any kind.  3) I am very seriously touched that people who introduce most of the chaos and natiolistic bias to this article are the first to accuse others of vandalism and extreme nationalism.   20:45, 26 Oct 2003 (UTC)   My suggestion: let's write what Silesia is now   The Silesia article DO need some serious improvement if we want it to be the valuable and reliable resource for the internet users. The current (restored and protected) version contains so many errors that it will chase away people with basic historical knowledge, if it's not changed as soon as possible.  1) First I suggest that we write what Silesia is now (as this is most interesting to the reader), and not what is was in the past. Silesia rich history should be discussed in the history section.  2) It is unacceptable to state that Silesia lies between Odra and Vistula rivers. First look at any map will show you that Silesia lies along the Odra river.  3) Silesia lies today in Poland and Czech Republic. It is doubtful if the Goerlitz area is part of Silesia. It is a historical part of Lusatia, and was joined to the Silesian province after 1816.  4) Im my opinion we should not discuss Silesian history in the intro paragraph, but we decide to, it is unacceptable to mention only the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation  5) I do not care in what order the language-names of Silesia are mentioned, but I do insist that the Silesian version (Ślónsk, Ślunsk) is included in this list.   6) I do insist that the various nationalities and ethnic groups living know in SIlesia, are mentioned clearly and the list should include at least: the Silesians, the Poles, the Germans, the Czechs  7) The theories about the name of the region must be clearly marked as theories and not as facts. The passages need some minor rewrite.  8) The remarks about HRE overlordship in 1146 and 1163 are simply false, no longer upheld by the German historians, and must be removed  9) Great care must be taken when dealing with Silesian history, for example the rude remarks about devastation was caused by Hussite rebellion must be rewritten using neutral words  10) The Silesia article need more sections on the People, Economy, Culture, Education, Science and Tourism.   20:55, 26 Oct 2003 (UTC)	0

131069	GT Pro Series   GT Cube is a separate game in many regards and it should have its own article, despite the merge that was decided on here. It was released in June 2003 in Japan, while GT Pro Series was released in January of 2007 in Japan  that's a four year release difference and contrary to the talk in the other article, not similar at all to a multi-platform game being released on multiple systems. The Wii version came packaged with its own wii-remote and has a graphical update. It should be noted that in his review for GT Pro Series, Mark Bozon commented on the similarity between the games, but he meant it as more of an insult  not a comment on the fact that they're exactly the same game. When two games have such similar control schemes, how can any of us seriously say that these are the same game?  Nomader (Talk)   Because the Wii version looks worse than any other Wii game I have played and worse than most GameCube games I have played.

At night, transpiration usually does not occur because most plants have their stomata closed. When there is a high soil moisture level, water will enter plant roots, because the water potential of the roots is lower than in the soil solution. The water will accumulate in the plant creating a slight root pressure. The root pressure forces some water to exude through special leaf tip or edge structures, hydathodes, forming drops. Guttation is not to be confused with dew, which condenses from the atmosphere onto the plant surface. |credit=Photo credit:	0

13367	"""= Sample of bona fide sources demonstrating, or referring to, official US recognition of Scientology as a religion ===  Here is how the New York Times commented on the 1993 tax exemption:   The landmark reversal shocked tax experts and saved the church tens of millions of dollars in taxes. More significantly, the decision was an invaluable public relations tool in Scientology's worldwide campaign for acceptance as a mainstream religion. On the basis of the I.R.S. ruling, the State Department formally criticized Germany for discriminating against Scientologists. The German Government regards the organization as a business, not a tax-exempt religion, the very position maintained for 25 years by the American Government.   I think the NY Times writer clearly expresses the view here that the US abandoned their earlier view of Scientology as a business, as still espoused today by Germany.   Note that the State Department Report referred to in the NY Times article is the """"Religious Freedom Report."""" The Religious Freedom Reports for Germany have discussed discrimination against Scientologists by the German state almost every year since the IRS decision, referring in 2006 for example to """"certain religious minorities, notably Scientologists"""".   Following the 1993 IRS decision, the IRS wrote to foreign governments, appending a document entitled """"Description of the Scientology Religion"""" to their letter and stating that various Scientology organizations had demonstrated that """"they were organized and operated exclusively for religious or charitable purposes and that no part of their net earnings inures to the benefit of any private individual.""""   Media references to the """"Scientology religion"""" (and similar references to Scientology as a religion) are common.   The Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties says that """"Despite its legal setbacks, Scientology has achieved full legal recognition as a religious denomination in the United States.""""   As for the claimed inability of any governmental entity in the United States to determine what is or is not a religion, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, stated in a 1992 decision that """"Indeed, the IRS itself has stipulated in other cases that the Church of Scientology is a bona fide religion.""""; so in the view of that court at least, the IRS has been quite capable of making such stipulations.   The St. Petersburg Times wrote in 1998 that """"After a 40-year battle, the IRS dropped its tax dispute with Scientology and declared it a tax exempt religion in 1993.""""

Fast forward to July 17, 2011, where Daniel Bryan, largely seen as a too-small wrestler with no personality in a federation trying to distance itself from """"wrestling"""", won the Smackdown Money in the Bank Ladder Match.  This won him, in storyline, the unilateral right to a WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at any point over the next year.  Last Friday (aired  it actually was taped on Tuesday), he announced that he would cash in that title opportunity at Wrestlemania XXVIII.  http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2011-07-22/results was the source I used.  WWE also has an interview up with Bryan now which was not up when I made the edit.  My issue is that, since the Money in the Bank winner can choose to cash his briefcase any time, he had chosen to do so at Mania XXVIII  and at that moment, became a scheduled match for WrestleMania XXVIII.  Ruth is using the Mr. Kennedy situation to claim that match probably will not take place (Kennedy (now Mr. Anderson, a previous MitB winner, wanted to do the same thing (cash at Wrestlemania), but was quickly unseated by Edge, cancelling that match).  The problem with this is two-fold:  One, it presumes (WP:Crystal, again!) that Bryan will, because he is not seen favorably by Vince McMahon (nor by many WWE marks), lose not only his briefcase but his real-life place on the WWE roster by Mania XXVIII.  Two, if me putting that match up is WP:Crystal, then so, at this early date, is Rock-Cena.  Ruth claims she has WWE travel packages which have already advertised Rock-Cena for Mania XXVIII, but has consistently refused to reference them.  She claims exactly what JaC stated above as sufficient to not only keep Rock-Cena, but remove Bryan from the card AND silence me from saying otherwise!  So I went to the WP:Crystal page and applied the relevant clause. Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. Dates are not definite until the event actually takes place. If preparation for the event is not already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented.  The event, by the WWE Universe, is notable (it's a Smackdown main event for the largest card of the year for the company), is at least as certain to take place (at the moment) as Rock-Cena (and if that fact changes, we can change the Mania XXVIII page when it does), and the documentation is on WWE's own website, which I provided you.  I believe Ruth is a typical WWE mark, like this other *mumblemumblemumble* up here, and believes that Daniel Bryan is not worthy of even a WWE contract.  I believe her stand is prejudicial, selective, and wrong.  Good faith went out the door about 15 posts ago.  And I do NOT believe in consensus if the consensus is demonstratably wrong!   """	0

When I said 'boring' I was using it as a derogatory term in general. Although he is boring, I was attacking him because I don't buy his theories because I think he presents them in an unintelligent light.

You know, how young toddlers seem to have super-charged immune systems (important for surviving day-care) whereas older people get sick more readily?  One cute factoid I gleaned from a dentist was that older people get a lot more cavities because they have dry mouths; producing less saliva means fewer protective peptides and they suck on sweet lozenges to wet their whistles, providing a nice diet of pure sucrose for their unwelcome guests.  Anyway, speaking more generally, I think that lay readers would be really interested in the whole age-dependence thing, as it touches all their lives.  Maybe someone there can look into it?

111868	Edit warring Please note that repeated attempts to remove sourced material from articles is likely to be considered to be edit warring, which may result in your being blocked from further editing of Wikipedia either temporarily or permanently.  If you try to make a significant change to an article, and somebody else reverses it, the appropriate thing to do is to go to the talk page, have a reasoned discussion, and try to come to a joint view of what is the best way forward for the article (see WP:BRD).  Merely trying to ram through the change you want to make by altering the article again and again is not acceptable, and will lead to sanctions being applied.  For the moment, the article Haplogroup O-M176 (Y-DNA) has been locked for two weeks, so that no-one may edit it.  If you sincerely believe that there are issues with some of the material being presented, please discuss your concerns on the talk page, and try to find an acceptable way forward.  Note, however, that WP exists to make accessible material that has been published in what it considers to be reliable sources.  If the material appears significant and relevant to the article, and has been published in a legitimate academic journal, normally one would expect to find it included in the article.  Even if the material is questionable, if it is in wide circulation and often presented in discussions of the topic, then on those grounds alone it should still be included.  If there are good grounds for questioning the material, those grounds can be discussed in the article  but note that they must reflect the position of reliable sources that have been published and can be referenced, not just your own personal beliefs, knowledge, or unpublished research. (See WP:NOR for more information).

FM then removed evidence that showed he was acting inappropriately.  He also made a previous block on 20 July 2006, incorrectly citing the arbcom decision of 'associated articles', while first providing no evidence, then false evidence (diff he provided was not to Ken Ham), to justify his accusation and inappropriate block.

33059	None of those two books are quoted - how am I supposed to know if, and to what extent, they dispute Hirst's book? The quote you do adduce, though horribly POV to be honest, in no way implies that was a casus belli for the invasion of Lebanon. As for the two other sources I added today, the book is peer reviewed and therefore is fit for Wikipedia. The editorial is syndicated in a mainstream source, The Independent, and has an extremely notable author when the subject is Israel, Palestine and Lebanon: Robert Fisk. It more than surpasses Wikipedia's notability standards. And I just added a third book about Israel's military history.	0

Run batted in says: """"The term may be pluralized as either RBI or RBIs"""". Obviously not vandalism then but a difference in opinion then. @Matt Guerrier, the reason it didn't show up was because a """"|"""" was missing, and with your edit you re-removed it and duplicated info.

Oh, and technically, the plural of RBI is RsBI, but that just looks clunky. In common usage, """"RBI"""" is used for either singular """"Run Batted In"""" or plural """"Runs Batted In"""". """"RBIs"""" is a bastardization used only because it's simpler from a usage standpoint.

As to RBIs, as X96lee15 pointed out the most thorough treatment is at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Baseball/Archive_5#RBIs.  Plus, mlb.com is the official reporter of baseball, and uses the RBIs convention.  Yet, Jackal4's reaction to that is to go on pages where I have written it thus, to delete the s  as though the s is incorrect.  He has done the same with """"at bat""""  which he insists must be hyphenated.  Etcetera .... these are just two of the types of reverts he feels impelled to make of my edits.  It is picayune, but it is wrong to revert perfectly good edits.  If he insisted on lower-casing RBIs, or any similar degradation, I would think it wrong of him to follow people around and revert perfectly good edits.  There is enough good work he could perform instead.     Well, I can't stop him from wasting time if that's what he wants to do ) .   As for """"thorough treatment"""", I'm not sure I consider a bit to which a grand total of two people contributed particularly thorough. I respect Kingturtle, but I think he's got it wrong on this one. Regarding what mlb.com uses, you're appealing to the wrong authority, because it's not a terminology issue, it's a grammar issue.   In any case, at this point I have no doubt that these edits are being reverted simply because you're both watching for each other's names on your watchlists. Allow me to again encourage the both of you to just stay away from each other's edits entirely for a while and allow the bad feelings to ebb.

As stated on the talk page there, you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left.  These are terms both I and Ron, himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the Canadian League of Rights. I could explain why here, but I won't bore you with the details.  However, I do reject the notion that everything must link to a Wiki article.  I am editing at another page, where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy. I will not object to so-called Left or Right sources, as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to Mr. Gostick.  The archives at the Australian League of Rights will have plenty of published materials on him, League objectives and views or anyone associated with him. This is one link that was removed in favor of David Lethbridge's document (hardly a non-politcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what Gostick and the League of Rights stood for).  I will try to help you find sources, fair and credible in the near future, doing edits myself.  I just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him.  I know well what he and the League of Rights stand for, as I have been involved with it for near 30 yrs. There is no denying he was anti-totalitarianism and that includes anti-zionist, which automatically brings down the bogus smear of """"anti-semitism' and other such nonsense.  An editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about.  I have notified Paul Fromm of the wiki page and link to him at Gostick's page, in case he didn't know it existed.  Be aware that Wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons, edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later.

103282	Admin abuse is and has been rampant for years. Admin's can do nearly anything including violate policy and get away with it. This is determinatal to the health of the project and causes a lot of users to leave. Of course nothing will ever be done because its impossible to get a consensus so the problems continue, admins see they can get away with nerly anything and its nearly as hard to get someone desysopped as remove them from Civil service for the US government. The only thing at this point that will change it is for the foundation to finally show an interest in the project, quite the benign neglect and quite turning their back to the problem. What we need is a couple folks at the foundation to ride herd over the Admin cadre. To keep them inline, make sure things are happening the way they should and when necessary put them back in their place. This will not only help to solve the admin problem but will also give them some credibility which I'm sorry to say has been lacking and getting worse. Having said all that I know thats not going to happen, most readers of this will probably just think I am ranting and will ignore it and nothing will continue to happen.	0

I think you would agree one of the most prevalent items making up today event is the unbelievable amount of misinformation continually supplied to the public Consciousness about this subject, including unproven theory from the best of tree Experts.

Yes even some facts seperatly belong within their specific wiki pages, like possible extinction of American Fraxinus placed on Fraxinus page. Or each page for 43 individual arthropods co-extinction caused by loss of ash. Separate """"Infestation"""" page would have been central location where temporally collected items regarding main subject could be kept. Lets work together, thanks.    Hi . First off, please remember to put new sections on a talk page at the bottom (this is done automatically by using New section). That and other things are outlined at WP:TPG and help make sure things stay ordered. For content on the EAB page, there's a bit behind all those edits I made awhile back, so stick with me:  I realize a lot of stuff I condensed was your previous work, but right now everything seems to fit together well. The merging was mainly based on parsing things down, but also how we deal with scientific content at Wikipedia. It's definitely the ideal for Wikipedia articles in general that we summarize what the scientific consensus is on topics such as this. If you haven't already, I highly suggest reading WP:SCIRS, which gives a good outline on what we should be trying to do with scientific content. Essentially, we're striving to summarize what other reliable sources say for an encyclopedia. That means pulling from review articles since they do that for us. However, part of that is because we don't generally regard primary sources (i.e. research articles) as reliable because those are communications within the scientific community. That's because those articles are intended for other researchers to evaluate, and the general public (e.g. Wikipedia editors) are not qualified to assess whether the study was valid. For us as Wikipedia editors, we cannot assign what we call due WP:WEIGHT to an idea or specific study until it's put in context through other researchers commenting on it or giving it validity (e.g. review articles). Now an introduction section can count as a mini-review article, but we generally don't need that in this topic since we have a few review articles to pull from.   With all that said, it is not our goal to describe what the primary research is. That's why I cut down a lot of the content as it was reading more like a journal than an encyclopedia (see WP:NOTJOURNAL). It's very different writing content for say an academic paper than it is for a Wikipedia article. From what I've gathered about your edits, you're very interested in generating very detailed information, which is perfectly normal for someone just getting their feet wet on scientific content here. However, the general goal of an encyclopedia is to have summarized information with references that lead to the more detailed information. A lot of the edits you're probably interested in including still largely fall under that question of due weight such as whether we even include the content or how much detail does it get. It's a learned skill, so I'm happy to explain things further at the EAB page is it's directly related or here if it's more general (i.e. Wikipedia's policies and guidelines) if you have questions or something isn't clear.

32673	"""  Opie, your statement """"You don't honestly believe that the author of the golf tee book is making things up""""…. is foolish. Many books and authors present fraudulent and construed information. Some of these authors print information that is researched haphazardly and sometimes not researched at all.  This is why reputable authors research and verify the content they use with Agencies that hold the fact-based and documented information. You consistently use the book The Singular History of the Golf Tee by Irwin R. Valenta, along with the website “Scottish Golf History” as a fact-based source. Looking at the website alone I find an abundance of erroneous and inaccurate information and patents. One just for example, is the U.S. patent of Mr. Dalziel in 1896. This patent, is claimed on the site as a “golf tee,” but in actuality is a device to be used in a game of Tennis and has no relation or bearing on the game of golf.  See patent #567,455 This is just one of the flagrant inaccuracies that are included in the links and information you have provided.  Another example of a site that has inaccurate information is Pat Ryan Golf timeline. It states that the Bloxsom & Douglas patent originated in 1899. Whether these “inaccuracies” are intentional or not, it is the lack of due diligence of the authors and originators that seems to be the issue.  Once corrected information has been verified and deemed accurate, upon the notification to the necessary parties, the erroneous information should be removed.  If it is not, then one is lead to believe that the misinformation by the author or originator is intentional.   All of the U.S. patents can be verified through the U.S. Patent office website. However, you say that the UK office has patents that are unsearchable through their website. It seems very suspicious that all of the patents that are quoted in the book seem to be “unavailable” through the UK patent office website for verification. """	0

38173	Recent AfD on Christianity and Judaism ==  Hi! I see that you were one of the participants in the recent AfD on the article Christianity and Judaism.  That AfD recommended (in a snowball result) that the article be merged into Judeo-Christian.  However, since the AfD concerns have been raised, most notably  Per WP:ADJECTIVE and WP:MOSNAME, we use nouns and noun-phrases for article titles, not adjectives.  So a general survey on the relationships between Christianity and Judaism (a topic this encyclopedia should certainly cover) should be called Christianity and Judaism, as per the articles Christianity and Islam, Islam and Judaism.  The reason the article Judeo-Christian exists, as its own hatnote declares, is specifically to survey the history and use of that word-phrase  which has its own controversy, and its own tale to tell.  (See here where I've set things out in a bit more detail.)  That story is a good fit for its own article, and will get completely lost if the contents of Christianity and Judaism get inappropriately dumped on top of it.  Having contacted the closing admin, his advice was to open a new discussion at Talk:Christianity and Judaism, advertise the discussion widely, and if a new consensus can be reached in that discussion [his emphasis], then per WP:CCC the new consensus should be followed, rather than the AfD decision, without the need for a DRV or a new AfD.  Concerns about the proposed merge have also been expressed by ,  and .  This post is therefore to let you know that that discussion is underway, at Talk:Christianity and Judaism#Overly speedy deletion, with a view to perhaps setting aside the AfD decision.    Of course, some significant issues were raised in the AfD about the article in its present form, so the best way forward is a question that needs some thought.  Please feel welcome to come and participate!      ==	0

52271	Re:Mere Rubbish == I also think it is mere rubbish but I also think it is not completely rubbish. According to the southeast asian history, most of the ancient rulers of this region are Hindus, some rulers came from Persia (map covered Middle east, Greece, west India - Achaemenid Empire, Seleucid Empire, Parthian Empire and Sassanid Dynasty, please look at the size of the map their conquered). Kedah is a good example where the king from Persia came and eventually he built a kingdom.  In the old days, it was slavery society (no sultanate and no democracy yet), all Hindu rulers belong to higher class, common peoples and the natives belong to inferior slave class. The Hindus rulers came from India and Persia and they ruled most of the southeast asia, they called themselves high class peoples, the rest are merely slaves. Parameswara is a Hindu ruler, he is one of the descendants of the Hindu royal family that belong to higher class of Hinduism.  As for the Macedonian bloodline, this is also not completely rubbish. In the old days, the Persian empire was so big, they are so proud with king Alexander the Great. Also, they ruled some of the southeast asian lands such as the Angkor, Pasai, etc. Parameswara later married Pasai's princess and adopted Persian Shah and claimed as descendant of Alexander the Great, I don't think all this is completely rubbish.  Anyway, please correct me, I may be wrong too.    ==	0

You seem to be arguing that there should be an article split, one article for the global and a split out article for the USA centric views.  Right?

That is a shame because this sort of experimentation is so fruitless.

However, almost all sources agree that, had the Italian Battleship and Cruisers remained at anchor, or had the Italian ships failed to make contact with the convoy, the British delivery of supplies would be completed according to schedule, namely, before sunrise. This disruption of the Royal Navy plans, along with the damage inflicted upon the escorting units, made the cargo ships an easy prey for the German and Italian torpedo-bombers the morning after the battle.  The only cargo ship to make Malta undamaged by the bombs was the Talabot, largely overdue from the original timetable. All the other were hit in some degree by axis aircraft BEFORE reaching the harbour (not just Clan Campbell, which means that the Royal Navy was still responsible for the steamers fate), further hampering the escorts effort to disembark the supplies in time.  So, despite the remarkable skills of the British units to save the merchantment from an attacking Battleship, the naval engagement should be considered a marginal victory to the Italians.  On the other hand, had the British deceived their enemy or in some way avoid major contact with the Italians and reached La Valetta at dark, yes, the Royal Navy success would be undeniable.  00:52 February 28 2007 (UTC"""	0

Heissig's book won't do; he treads literature well into the 40s of the 20th century, but only those kinds of literature the tradition of which began earlier. Unfortunately, (but not unexpectedly) the library of Bonn seems to contain no books that tread literature after the mid 80s. Maybe Göttingen, or I might buy something myself in late summer.

75551	"""== Audio File ==  DCGeist is vandalising this article by repeatedly removing content while refusing to exaplin the problem or start a discussion to correct the problem.  The problem, he says, is """"style"""", which he believes """"very clearly explains the problem"""".  He prefers to delete content rather than help to edit the page to allow its inclusion.  Is United States to be the only country in the Western Hemisphere without an audio file for pronunciation of the name?   When did """"style"""" become so important that it justifies the deletion of content over style correction?     The addition is ungrammatical. It clutters the article's opening sentence. It is visually off-putting and difficult to read. This is a very significant stylistic concern; by contrast, the addition of an audio clip pronouncing two common English words is a minor and unnecessary matter of content.—     Could you explain why you think the addition is ungrammatical in the parenthetical comment?  Do you have a proposed solution that will avoid deleting content, or is deleting content your purpose?  The opening can be reworded, rather than deleting content.  Please note that the pronunciation, even of """"common"""" words in English is of value to both non-native speakers as well as native-born speakers, since even common words may change pronunciation within a proper name.  Please justify having only one country in North America whose article is forbidden to contain an audio file.     While remaining mostly neutral on this front, please don't call something """"vandalism"""" when it's not. This is a disagreement, and under the terms of """"Bold, Revert, Discuss"""", the onus is actually now upon you to justify its inclusion, not the other way around. But either way, it's not obvious vandalism. It annoys admins when people throw that term around. Or at least me. And as for """"Is United States to be the only country in the western hemisphere"""", I point out that """"United States"""" is the only country name in the Western hemisphere made up entirely of common words, without proper names. (""""of America"""" is different, of course, but the audio file isn't about that name) So there is an argument to say that it is the country least in need of a pronunciation guide, since there's no unusual or proper words in that particular name.     But """"united"""" contains vowels which do not behave in the way that non-native speakers expect.  I have taught English overseas, and have seen the problems firsthand.  The word """"united"""" has no encyclopedia article here, nor pronunciation given, for a non-native speaker to examine.  Also, the word """"states"""" is a plural, and English plurals have two possible pronunciations for the added final """"-s"""": /s/ or /z/, according to rules that native speakers learn but which non-native speakers struggle with.

However, IMO the text in the article is too strong for what the source supports.   conclusions from PMID 23512950, Harrow 2013 Overall, the longitudinal studies cited do not provide conclusive proof of a causal relationship between being off medications and being psychosis free. They do clearly indicate that not all schizophrenia patients need continuous antipsychotics for a prolonged period, providing extensive evidence of samples of medication-free schizophrenia patients with favorable outcomes.6,12,22 Is it at least a moderate-sized number of schizophrenia patients who do well, longitudinally, without medications? This important issue needs longitudinal research for more precise answers. The longitudinal studies indicate the importance of further research on how many schizophrenia patients profit from continuous administration of antipsychotics over a prolonged period, what factors identify and separate schizophrenia patients who do not need prolonged antipsychotic treatment, and whether or not prolonged use of antipsychotics is harmful for some or many patients.  The above-cited longitudinal results from many different countries and different types of schizophrenia patients provide data bearing on issues about long-term treatment. Discussions by Whitaker, Moncrieff, and others question long-term antipsychotic treatment.25–27 These disparate views, research by WHO and DOSMED in developing countries,12 and our own longitudinal studies5–7 should be considered as prompts for further long-term outcome research on this important issue.

50883	"""== Literal text == I have changed """"According to the literal text of the constitution, the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen of Australia."""" to refer to Queen Victoria instead. I did this to make a point and that point is that the literal text of the Constitution cannot be taken as an unfailingly reliable guide to either practice or law.  Read the Constitution and you will find no mention of the Prime Minister, who is undeniably the head of government, even if one might imagine that this position is occupied by the Governor-General from a cursory reading of the Constitution. The Constitution declares that there shall be an Inter-State Commission, but the truth is that this body does not exist.  Please, if you refer to the literal text of the Constitution, either stick to the literal text and refrain from inserting material that does not belong - you will search in vain for the title """"Queen of Australia"""", for example - or qualify it by referring to documents and events such as the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953 where the title """"Queen of Australia"""" was introduced.  23:44, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)  Skyring - It is interesting how your own comments can be used to demonstrate how you add your own point of view - """"I did this to make a point!"""". A point about """"literal"""" text is make by using the adjective """"literal"""". Your point belongs elsewhere.  Anyway, the literal text does not mention """"Queen Victoria"""" it mentions the """"Queen"""". It further states that the """"Name of the King or Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the time being is to be substituted from time to time"""". This is what I has done. Maybe, there is a more accurate way of making this subtitution, but """"Queen Victoria""""! That's wrong, wrong, wrong!  Is it? Have you checked the original? I think that you will find that instead of checking, you jumped in with some more untruths. Please think instead of responding when I press your buttons.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)  I notice you haven't responded to this. Have you checked the original? This is in Parliament House, and is on public didplay.  00:04, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)  Yes I have checked: www.foundingdocs.gov.au  """"Not found The page you requested is not available at this address."""" I suggest you check the original. I have.  00:29, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)  Rather than just jump in and make changes after 15 seconds thought, go back have a think for serveral days before you start adding stuff like this!. It just wastes time. Also, when you say """"Please!"""", """"Read the constitution"""", you are showing contempt for others.   01:02, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)  When someone makes an obvious mistake like saying the literal text of the Constitution refers to the Queen of Australia, then I am quite justified in asking that person to read it.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)  If you refer to the """"literal text"""" of the Constitution you will have to concede that it contains no reference to a """"Queen of Australia,"""" and that is because the thought of Australia as a state separate from the British Empire would have been quite foreign to the men who wrote the Constitution.  01:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)  I explained the substitution logic above and applied it. Then skyring put in """"Queen Victoria"""" !!! So I reduced it to just just """"Queen"""" (ie no substiution.) I have no problem either way.  11:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)  Let's stick with the Queen, shall we? That's probably the best bet.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)  I thought the point about literal text had been made, but I see that it has not been appreciated. The Constitution does not state that the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen. If you want to quote the literal text of the Constition, then by all means do so, but don't go making stuff up that you think might or should or could be in there, when it clearly isn't.  23:49, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)  Nowhere in the literal text of the Constitution will you find the statement """"the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen"""". Nowhere. s2 states """"A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's representative"""". That is a clear statement of intention. I noted s101 previously, which states: """"There shall be an Inter-State Commission"""". There is not an Inter-State Commission, so clearly it is incorrect to say that the literal text of s2 means that the Governor-General is now the Queen's representative, given the example"	0

56401	"""  Without a metatheory, one does not have a truth predicate, which complicates things for realism, because the whole point of that philosophy is that sets really do exist and actually do have the properties ascribed to them. One could argue in favor of a disquotational definition of truth, but that merely pushes the problem around, leading to the same problems as full second-order semantics for arithmetic.   Also, not having a metatheory means that one must treat set theory differently than other branches of mathematics, such as group theory or linear ordering theory. This seems like a difficult distinction to justify.   I do think that the """"no metatheory"""" interpretation of ZFC (or Zermelian set theory, if you prefer that) is somewhat common, because it is one way of avoiding the issue that what is called V in the object theory cannot be distinguished from a set in the metatheory. One consequence of my original point is that it would also be coherent to interpret this no-metatheory language merely as a way of making statements from the viewpoint of a person inside a particular model of set theory. Moreover, this interpretation is entirely compatible with the viewpoint that there is an objectively-defined collection consisting of all sets, if no additional meta-level principles such as the ability to force over V are added. However, if one already viewed """"all sets"""" as merely a façon de parler with no objective referent, as I think you are proposing, then it's not clear why one sort of disquotation (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets"""") is better than another (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets in the model at hand""""). — Carl ( · talk) """	0

Then I said it was obvious to me that Mickey Mouse looked Nordic and I wasn't taking the picture out.  Then what?  You demand a reliable source that says Mickey Mouse looks Nordic and that the Nazis considered him to look Nordic and therefore considered Mickey Mouse to be an example of their highest racial phenotype.  How else would we settle the issue?

138619	Heleen Mees (born Heleen Nijkamp, 1968, Hengelo)[1] is a Dutch opinion writer, economist and lawyer. She has been credited as being a third wave feminist.[3]  Contents  [hide]  TABTAB1 Biography TABTAB2 Publications TABTAB3 References TABTAB4 External links  Biography Mees graduated in Economy and Law at University of Groningen. From 1992 to 1998, Mees worked for the Dutch Treasury in The Hague. From 1998 to 2000 Mees worked as a national expert for the European Commission in Brussels.[5] In 2000 she emigrated to the USA, where she changed her surname to Mees.[6] Mees lives in Brooklyn, New York.[2]  Mees' breakthrough as an opinion writer in the Netherlands came in 2006 when she wrote The time is long overdue that women should go to work.[8] That same year, she co-founded Women on Top, an organization that until 2011 advocated more women in top jobs.[9]   From 2006 to 2010 Mees wrote a bi-weekly column in NRC Handelsblad, and from 2012 to 2013 for Het Financieele Dagblad. Her work has been published in the Financial Times, Foreign Policy and other international newspapers. Currently she is a columnist for Project Syndicate[11] and the German magazine Capital. Mees is the author of three books.   In August 2012, Mees completed a doctoral thesis at the Erasmus School of Economics, focusing on the effect of China's economy on the emergence of the 2008 global financial crisis.[13] While completing her research, she worked as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Tilburg University.[14] From September 2012 until July 2013, Mees was employed as an Adjunct Associate Professor of Public Administration at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.[15]  In July 2013, Mees was arrested in New York on charges of stalking her former lover, the chief economist of Citigroup, Willem Buiter.[16] In March 2014, the court decided that the case against Mees was to be dismissed in one year provided that she complies with two conditions.[17]	0

If you really want to know why the article, for most of its life, has not included anything about Jesus' """"Hebrew name"""" or """"Aramaic"""" name in the lead, I encourage you to look at the talk page archives, as we had at least two lengthy discussions when, two times in the past, someone proposed this (what bothers me about the current situation is, someone changed the long-standing consensus version without any such discussion).  Did you know that many Pharisees who lived around the time of Jesus had Greek names or Greek derived names (Greek names spelled out in Hebrew letters)? Tarfon, Antigonus, Abtalion ... These are actually names of Rabbis recorded in the Mishnah, who probably spoke Aramaic on a daily basis, and Hebrew in their studies (the Mishnah is written in Hebrew) - yet they had Greek or """"Hellenized"""" names.  Alexander was a popular name at this time. This of course does not mean that Jesus was given a Greek name rather than a Hebrew name, or a """"Hellenized"""" Hebrew name, when he was born. We have no idea. It probably is not likely, but we have no idea. This is not """"my"""" point, but one brought up by many editors who have made major contributions to the Jesus article.   I think it is pretty standard practice throughout Wikipedia that, when an article wishes to address a complex issues - perhaps because it is controversial, or there are many diverse views, or it is speculative, or for whatever reason, requires time to explain to readers why there is no certainty, why it is not a """"fact"""" - we do not shy away from such topics but rather address them in the body of the article but not in the lede.  For very obvious reasons, we do not mention in the lede everything that is in the body.  I don't object to including speculation in the article, but until someone added this stuff sometime in the past month, there was a consensus among all the editors who had made major contributions to the article not to put this speculation in the lead.     |  Talk """	0

If anybody want indian I sure can provide hindi sources which all of confirms the ghuri kingdom to be Pathans. Because they were major player in history of india. I think most of their era was spend in India, I remember Karturaghti's mentioning that Ghurids were not Farsi and that their offspring hated Farsi as well and did not wanted to be spoken in their courts. With all respect to Iranian dominated wikipedian but we have to admit that Pashtuns or Afghans are really disrespected in this matter specially in their So called true and first pashtun dynasty. Many of our sources point out that Pathans were the owners of Ghurid kingdom and in fact if someone looks at the word Pathan they will see the picture clearly of how it came to be noticed by indians as first muslim """"invaders"""".  Also talk The Iranica's is too vague if Šansabānī family were persian Sassanian/middle persian and it comes the word from the name """" Wišnasp"""" and who was  Wišnasp, what or who was  Wišnasp? Iranians and indians always exchange names such as Iraj should we claim Iraj to be an indian just because its an indian name drived Raj?  Wišnasp does help in anything only one guy Justi, Namenbuch, in  282 mentions about Wišnasp with less than 10 word and not even details. So we believe in that just because Iranica says so? I personally don't see any logical trace between.  I remember reading this even back in india how come muzzafudin said when Arabs came we were not aware of Arabs or Islam our forefathers accepted Islam and blessed by khlifa Ali?  The Shansbani might of knew about their root and if they were persian or any ruling dynasty related to persia they would take pride and condamn the Arabs like the parsis of india. One sure thing I know that suri by their own word were the first muslims of Afghanistan and considered themselves anti-persian. Because the fella called Farsiwan seems to pull out something which I researched. Correct me if I am wrong why did Suri mention in shahnameh killed the last king of Persia and helped spread Islam? Why did khawarzm who won hearts and minds of persian yat hated by sunni population and the hardcore sunni ghurids, who were pan-abbasids?.  The most important concept here is that Ghurid were Afghan and perhaps pure and since pashtuns claim it as own nothing wrong with that. Because every pashtun tribe or dynasty one way or other did not give up persian and it was always in their courts. Because of their nature being natives of Khorasan as many iranian intellectuals agree came modern Persian language so what is the problem?  68.171.231.17  """	0

48169	Where does Eagle Forum support Dominionism? For this to be useful, it should have some quote from Eagle Forum or from a reliable source that documents Eagle Forum support for Dominionism. But none of the references actually says that Eagle Forum has any Dominionist views. None of them is an objective source. And none of them actually criticizes some Eagle Forum view.  TheocracyWatch quotes Glenn Scherer saying that Eagle Forum has rated some US Senators differently from environmentalist groups. Mother Jones said that Eagle Forum has supported a Republican group, and some of those Republicans had once supported Pat Robertson. That is very far removed from Eagle Forum supporting Dominionism. If Eagle Forum says that environmentalism is contrary to the Bible, or if Eagle Forum supported Pat Robertson for president, then those things might be notable and criticism of those views might be notable.

38350	Reversion of PFS Conference   Since JDWOLFF is being a Wikipedia Nazi I have moved discussion to the talk page.  In my opinion, the information I have included is very germane and significant.  It demonstrates not only that medical practitioners are taking Post-Finasteride Syndrome seriously but also informs to those who may be suffering from negative persistent side effects from Propecia and Proscar that there are current ongoing studies.  While it may not be apparent on this Wikipedia article because JDWOLFF is very aggressive to remove comments he doesn't like, there is an ongoing controversy relating to the side effects of taking Propecia.  Many men have disregarded the claims since a handful of doctors remain ignorant to the potential risks of the drug and have been misinforming their patients only to lead additional patients to suffer what seems to be permanent side effects.  Please state your case as to why the information about the conference should not be included or else I would put it back up.

635	"""   Philosopher RFC  philosopher (from Wiktionary): A person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy.  I am going to make the case that we must call Stefan Molyneux a """"philosopher"""" (without qualifiers) in the lead.  This is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy, only that it is his career. (Note: Not all of the sources I use below are in the article at present. The point here is to first convince RFC respondents that """"philosopher"""" is accurate and widely accepted, then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place.)   Definitions  Obviously, each source is going to use slightly different phrasing. Some will call him explicitly a """"philosopher"""" or has views on """"philosophy"""", but I think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent. Using one word """"philosopher"""" in the lead sentence covers all of his political, ethical, and theistic specializations in one word, which we then elaborate on later in the article.   """"philosophical conversation"""", """"philosophy show"""" - used to describe his Freedomain Radio series  """"libertarian"""", """"libertarian thinker"""" - """"Libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies ...""""  """"anarcho-capitalist"""" - """"Anarcho-capitalism ... is a political philosophy...""""  """"voluntaryist"""" - """"Voluntaryism (or sometimes voluntarism), is a libertarian philosophy...""""  """"athiest"""" - """"Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches.""""  """"ethics- """"Ethics, sometimes known as philosophical ethics, ethical theory, moral theory, and moral philosophy, is a branch of philosophy""""  """"Secular ethics- """"Secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy...""""   Primary source  As Stefan Molyneux is a living person, we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him (obviously, we don't want to host any sort of """"fringe"""" claims). If we are to dispute what he says about himself, though, then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this, or we open Wikipedia to discredit or liability - this is why BLPs are held to strong standards in the first place. I think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct. He is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media, which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the """"old-school"""" philosophers we're used to.

113950	In Japan, Nobukatsu Fujioka, a professor of Takushoku University, mentioned, “Many translated books are published in Japan but Iris Chang’s “The Rape of Nanking” is not published. Because, it has so many mistakes that no publisher could have handled it. The photos are all false, and not a single picture was an evidence of the ‘Nanking Massacre.’ Not only that, her description about Japanese history is filled with absurd mistakes. For instance, she wrote that the Japanese military strength before the end of the Edo era (1603 -1867) had not exceeded the level of sword, bow and arrow (in fact, Japan was the biggest producer of guns in the world already in the 16th century). More than 100 such rudimentary mistakes were found in the book, and even if the book is published in Japan, no Japanese people could bear reading it. A left-wing publishing company tried to publish it with notes annotated by translator, but she refused it saying, “How impertinent.” Sad to say, the Americans trust such a book and are making movies.”   Shoichi Watanabe, a professor emeritus of Jochi University, mentioned, “Before World War II, a false document called the Tanaka Memorial was made in China. This was a purported Japanese strategic planning document from 1927, in which Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka laid out for Emperor Hirohito a strategy to take over the world. The American President Roosevelt, senators and congressmen read this forgery, and believed the lie that Japan had a malicious intention to take over Asia and the world. That became a cause for the US-Japan war. It is said that after reading it, Roosevelt decided to defeat Japan entirely. Iris Chang’s ‘The Rape of Nanking’ is the same. If we leave this lie as it is, it will certainly give a bad influence to the US-Japan relation.”	0

76036	I'll layout my mindset when writing Dennis Lo.  The employer contacted me because he had previously worked with me on another project unrelated to this.  He asked if I could write up an article.  I told him I needed 3 days to decide if I would take the job to determine if an article could even be written that was met guidelines.  I determined that there was, accepted the job, and wrote it.  Now, could the article have been written by anyone without getting paid?  Yes.  In fact, red links for Dennis Lo already existed in two other articles.  I gathered as many sources as I could and wrote what they said.  Did that prohibit me from being critical?  As seen in the Tops In Blue article, I can be critical of topics I have a COI in (I have a friend who was in TiB at the time I rewrote that article).  So what does payment get the employer?  Well, he doesn't have to wait for some random disinterested party to get around to writing it.  They arn't buying my integrity, it's not for sale.  They arn't buying my bit, that's not mine in the first place.  As far as I am concerned, me getting paid gets me to write in topic areas I normally wouldn't.  That's the only 'effect' it has on me.  I'm much more interested in this project than picking up some crappy freelance job that's going to lead to me being asked to leave.  My guess is that most established editors feel the same way.

80862	I can see the reasoning to split, but there have been two schools of thought about this for comics.  Obviously Green Lantern or Robin are examples of a superhero name taken by several individuals, but the standard seems to be to create a 'main' article about the character name/legacy and give some details about each.  If more detail is needed/warrented, provide a link to the 'main article'.  Obviously this is also affected by the significance of the character.  Starman (comics) for instance gives descriptions of all of the many characters with that name, but only re-links to those individuals who have been notable using that psuedonym.  For Shadowhawk it seems as if the mantle of this character was passed cleanly from one person to another, so I'd say keep it all in one article as with articles such as Phantom Lady or Black Canary.	0

Please don't take the following as a negative reflection but I wanted to clarify a couple things. People are frustrated because now, as in the past, it seems as thought the WMF doesn't listen to what us editors are saying. Yes you have evidence that you tried to notify users but the way the notifications were done and the places they were located gives the impression that the folks building these changes don't understand the community or how it works. You are also worknig hard to fix the problems but then releae the app to all logged in users knowing there are a lot of problems, many of which are severe. Then you act as though your surprised and hurt that we are annoyed. We know you are working on the problems, but so are we and we want to feel as though our voices are heard too. When the Visual Editor talk pages aren't filled with long lists of complaints and bugs, then we can talk about a widescale release. But there's no need to rush it out yet. Anyway, I just wanted to clarify that the problems aren't with you, they are with the WMF organizations's ongoing policy of doing whatever they feel like regardless of what us dumb editors think. Happy editing. PS, sorry they mixed us up.     Your user page   Hi Elitre, when we designed the  template, we intended to make it easy for staff to use it and edit it, so added parameters that would make it easy to update the relevant sections. I noticed that you'd substituted the template on your user page instead of transcluding it and presumed this was not intentional, so I've gone ahead and boldly switched it to the template, making a few general fixes. This should allow you to also edit your user page through the Visual Editor. Please feel free to undo my changes if you intended to substitute the template! -) helpfulone    Random act of kindness    Hello Elitre (WMF), Eduemoni has given you a shining smiling star!

85689	In light of Ted Cruz hearings and the evidence of warming adjustments, to Change the global temperature graph to RSS   In the Congressional meeting yesterday evidence was presented showing massive warming adjustments to surface data so that the whole 1940 to present warming could be explained by these warming adjustments alone. In sharp contrast, the global satellite temperature was stated by the majority of scientists to be the most credible scientifically. Moreover it is corroborated by the Meteorological balloon data. And independent evidence from growing Antarctic ice, that this year global sea ice is back to normal and even Greenland surface ice is growing strongly suggests that there is no current warming and that the surface data is corrupted either by these warming adjustments or by urban heating. Moreover the satellites are far more global than the surface data - and the increasing ice shows the areas they miss at the poles are not melting.  I would therefore propose that the present graph utilising the less scientifically valid surface data which is in no sense global nor accurate given the massive and judgemental adjustments should be removed and replaced with either UAH or RSS.	0

45458	Recent Edit  1. Moved the Hariakhan Baba paragraph above Post-Yogananda Claims. According to that entry Hariakhan Baba taught from 1860 (before Paramahansa Yogananda was born) to 1924 (before the publication of the Autobiography of a Yogi in 1946). People accepted and revered Hariakhan Baba as the Babaji since pre-Yogananda times. The timing of his appearance also coincides with Lahiri Mahasaya's Kriya Yoga initiation from Babaji (1861).  2. Corrected a minor spelling error from Hari Dasa to Hari Dass.  3. Added Roy Eugene Davis' name and book as support for the Mahavatar Babaji/Hariakhan Baba theory. Basically,  to show that there is someone from the lineage of the author of Autobiography of a Yogi who agrees with Dass and (Mahendra) Baba's conclusion. Roy Eugene Davis was ordained by Paramahansa Yogananda himself in 1951. So, for someone like him to agree that this Hariakhan Baba is the same as the Mahavatar Babaji mentioned by his Master and venerated by all legitimate kriyabans from the Lahiri Lineage is not a light matter.  4. Added Sidhoji Rao Shithole's legal and proper name.	0

21485	"""  Opening Bias   In the opening segment (If that's what you call it - I mean the first content, before the table of contents), there is the following paragraph:  The conflict killed at least 1,200 people, mostly Lebanese citizens,[38][39][40] severely damaged Lebanese civil infrastructure, and displaced approximately one million Lebanese[41] and 300,000–500,000 Israelis.[26][42][43] After the ceasefire, some parts of southern Lebanon remained uninhabitable due to Israeli unexploded cluster bomblets.[44]  It is blatantly obvious how anti-Israeli this paragraph is. The information might be true, and there is some doubt as to whether it actually is, but the way in which it is organized, especially in the opening segment, is ridiculously biased. A reader would probably read it whilst skimming the article, as it is the shortest paragraph in the opening segment, and then get the following information: Israel killed many Lebanese citizens; Lebanese civil infrastructure, which means hospitals, roads, etc., was destroyed by Israel, Israel displaced twice as much Lebanese civilians, and they used cluster bombs which render some Lebanese area uninhabitable.  Completely biased. Completely anti-Israeli. Completely ridiculous. Completely unacceptable of a Wikipedia article, especially a """"good"""" article.  I recommend either changing the wording (Maybe removing 'mostly Lebanese citizens', 'Lebanese', and changing it to approximately 1.5 million people displaced, as well as completely omitting the last sentence). The entire paragraph could be removed entirely, with some of the more important information being integrated to other paragraphs.  And, full disclosure, I am currently leaving in Israel, but I would be writing this irregardless of my current location; biased articles are biased articles globally. I was not influenced by my current country."""	0

65310	"""   revived / remains   So:  What Toptchyan wrote is that after Malkhasyants (1940, and Sarkissian's article is from March 1940, so just before it) and untill Toumanoff (1961), thus """"second half of the 20th century"""", there has been no serious scholarship opposing the 5th c. dating. You (Grandmaster) mentioned earlier Joseph P. Smith (1952) but (i) his book has an extremely thin link with the debate on the dating, (ii) he's not specialised in this area, and most of all (iii) he didn't take side in his very few lines on Moses. Topchyan not being contradicted on this, it is clear that there's a break of 21 years between Malkhasyants' book and the next serious scholar contesting the 5th c. dating (according to Topchyan, """"la publication de son livre régla la question pour environ deux décennies"""" or in English """"the publishing of his book settled the issue for approximately two decades""""). Therefore, during these two decades, the issue didn't """"remain"""" disputed (i.e. no serious scholarship published), and Toumanoff' s publishing """"revived"""" the critical points in 1961.  Where you perhaps have a point (with """"remains"""") is that Toumanoff's main point, the """"Bagratids argument"""", had already been raised before by Adontz and Manandian. It had been addressed by Malkhasyants though (i.e. Moses wrote that Bagratids were tagadir ev aspet, two titles from the Arsacid period which were forgotten in latter centuries).  I think the article should represent both the historiographical break and the historiographical link, and I think the current sentence do so (""""revived... continue to maintain""""). I tried to reword it, but in fact, the more I think about the issue and the more I read the sentence, the less I see the problem with it.    Oh, btw, no need to attack Toptchyan: Mahé for instance gives absolutely no reference between 1940 and 1961.     Did you actually read Sarkissian's article? He quotes authors from 1920s and 1930s, and says:   Such was, and to a large extent still is, the traditional view about the life and the work of Moses of Khoren which was accepted by the Armenians. It is this traditional and unquestioned view that has been subjected to much severe criticism during the course of the past hundred years. The object of this paper is to summarize and evaluate such criticism.  So according to Sarkissian, during the 100 years before 1940 the 5th century dating was constantly in dispute. Thus, Topchyan contradicts other sources. Criticism was not revived, it always existed. If you insist on revived claim, it must be presented only as Topchyan's personal opinion, and not as a fact, because it is not true. master """	0

15391	"""Haplogroup L lineages are relatively infrequent(less than 1%) throughout Europe with the exception of Iberia, where frequencies as high as 11.7% percent have been reported. These lineages had previously been associated with the African slave trade. However an analysis by Gonzalez et al revealed that most of the L lineages matched Northwest African L lineages rather than contemporary Sub-Saharan L lineages. The authors suggest this pattern indicates that most of the Sub-Saharan L lineages entered Iberia in prehistoric times rather than in more recent periods.   Haplogroup L lineages are present at low frequencies in Eastern Europe. Though a high diversity of African mtDNA lineages have been detected, few lineages have accumulated enough mutations in Europe to form monophyletic clusters. Malyarchuk et al 2005 detected only two monophyletic clusters, L1b and L3b, in Russians with an estimated age no greater than 6,500 years. Malyarchuk et al 2008 identified African L1b, L2a, L3b, L3d and M1 clades in slavic populations at low frequencies. L1b, L3b and L3d had matches with West African populations, indicating that these lineages probably entered Europe through Iberia. One lineage L2a1a, appeared to be much older, indicating that it may have entered Europe in prehistoric times. This clade was possibly related to L2a1 clades identified in 10 individuals of Ashkenazi heritage from France, Germany, Poland, Romania and Russia. L2a lineages are widespread throughout Africa, as a result, the exact origins of this lineage are uncertain.   """	0

Some larger ideological groups may contain a cultic core or special formations organized in a cult-like fashion (according to some accounts, the Third International operatives from various countries in the 1930s were treated virtually as cult zombies by Stalin's cynical bureaucrats). Arguably, Himmler's SS included cultic formations trained at that castle (Wewelsburg?) where they supposedly performed something called the ceremony of the stifling air (possibly this is a street legend). As to North Korea it is definitely a totalitarian state with an intense leader-cult religion (probably the most intense such formation that has ever existedone hesitates to describe it as a Stalin-style personality cult since even Stalin never strove for such a level of quasi-religious worship and regimentation). But I'm not sure the term """"political cult"""" is appropriate in reference to North Korea, since the term has been used up until now exclusively to refer to relatively small groups that don't wield state power and that employ elaborate psychological manipulation of their followers as a substitute for the patronage and secret-police power of a post-revolutionary state.Dking (Dennis King), 2 Sept 2006  =="""	0

108301	Let me be crystal clear here:  If pending changes are removed by any admin from any article, that admin is responsible for replacing them with either semi- or full protection (level 1), or full protection only (level 2), each with the same duration as the duration of the pending changes protection, whether or not the originally protecting administrator takes any action with respect to the RfC's closure.  This is due to the fact that any number of BLP subjects have threatened to sue Wikipedia for allowing defamation in their articles, and pending changes has been part of our good faith response.  This cannot easily be determined on-wiki, as most of the complaints and responses are in OTRS, rather than any on-wiki venue.  While I've made my honest best effort to include references to OTRS tickets when appropriate in protection summaries, there's no guarantee that the absence of any such OTRS ticket number indicates that the pending changes can be dropped.  Note also that non-BLP articles may have been placed under pending changes protection for BLP reasons, so an article on e.g., a corporation placed under pending changes protection may not be assumed to be not a BLP-relevant article.  Furthermore, regardless of the merit of such lawsuits, the fact is that Wikipedia's BLP goals are to do no harmit's an ethical stance with worldwide acceptance. The removal of Pending Changes as a tool does not change our obligation to BLP subjects in any way; it merely removes a tool that allows trusted non-autoconfirmed and non-administrator users to make changes to such articles.  If anyone was under the impression that the end of pending changes would automagically open any protected articles for free-for-all editing, they have likely not thought through the real world implications of BLP. I trust that this statement clarifies things sufficiently that unilateral un-protection of pending changes-protected articles doesn't become an issue.	0

And I had hoped that, because measurement is done both with clocks we build (to measure time in material reality) and with our conscious experience (which is debated among philosophers and lay people as to whether or not that is contained in material reality or is somehow different) that you guys (with the exceptions of SQ and JW) would see the wisdom of not jamming them together in a run-on sentence and see the wisdom of setting up the topic in all three major POVs: Time as phenomenon, Time as physical measurement, Time as experience right away in two lede sentences.

Just a question:  in the first part of the article, it talks about how the car should operate like an ICE vehicle, requiring the key to be turned to the Start position.  But then later in the article, it talks about breaking people of the habit of the pressing the accelerator pedal.  Maybe I'm one of those operators of older vehicles talked about, but I still press the accelerator when I start my car, whether it's fuel-injected or not.  So it seems like in the same description, it's trying to make the car start like an ICE vehicle, and yet not make it start like an ICE vehicle.   The rectangular area called In Cab confused me.  At first, I thought it was some special kind of component.  Then I came to think that, no, it's not a component at all; it just represents """"somewhere inside the cab.""""  I think this latter view is the correct one, but I'd like text and/or picture to make it clearer.  I'm also not sure what the short blue wire between """"Run Buss"""" and """"Run:"""" is for.  My guess is that it's for other systems that are activated only when the ignition state has been latched, but the text doesn't make that clearand this also added to my confusion about the In Cab being a component.   I don't know what this means:  """"The run buss is grounded when not in the run state, allowing additional interlocks to be included in order to ensure proper shutdown.""""   Where would these additional interlock be placed?  How would they ensure proper shutdown?    Finally, I had to think about diode D1.  When the key switch is in the Start position and both relays are enabled, there will be 12V on each side of the diode.  Therefore the diode won't conduct, since one side isn't lower in voltage than the other.  When the key switch is then returned to the On position, the Alarm-Start Relay will open, removing the +12V on the negative side of the diode, so the diode will start conducting, thus keeping the Latch Relay energized.  Is that correct?  If so, maybe an explanation could be added to that effect for dummies like me.  If not, then perhaps add a description of the way it really works.  Thanks for your good work here (That's for YOU, not me).  Hope this helps. - Bill Dennis  """	0

Her reprehensible conduct was antithetical to free speech and undermined the very purpose of this site: the democratization of public information.   You must understand that the concentration of power into the hands of a few administrators over an organization originally dedicated to open discourse and conversation is a bad thing. Please, tell me you understand that?   The fact that users, much like yourself and very certainly like Zoe (she was the personification of such disgusting aggression and bullying) casually ban editors with whom they have disagreements, that they randomly delete articles (often with no debate whatsoever) because they find them distasteful, that they threaten editors who dare challenge their bellicose absurdity, is not a good thing.  The user Mongo alone has literally hundreds of documented incidents of gross power abuse and often outright vandalism himself (see the ED article on him).   We live in an age when our Constitution is under attack on all fronts, when our phones are tapped, our mail is read, our bank accounts are sifted through, our libraries are monitored by the FBI, our civil liberties are disregarded, and freedom in the Land of the Free is driven back.   We need as much freedom of speech as we can get, and Wikipedia is an excellent repository for the endangered right.

The enviromentalism that Crichton criticises indeed does have the support of most states and politicians, but it is also the scientific consensus. If anything Crichton is the one who can be compared to Lysenko. His anti-environmental views contradict the scientific consensus and in this he has the support of many top politicians in the US, possibly even the current President.

135156	I'm also a little curious about facts like 'one of the seated jurors was a friend of the victims father'. The whole parish is only 14,282 people counting every man, woman, and child. The newsreporting to me sounds kind of biased in making it seem like the deck was stacked against Bell in that regard when in truth in a community that small it would have been almost impossible not to draw some connection within 1 or 2 degrees of seperation. I honestly do believe some of the events were biased against Bell (particularly charging him as an adult when the law clearly said that could not be done and the releveant factors the DA considered weren't considered relevant in prior LA SC decisions), but I think their is a reason you're not seeing that fact harped on... even the pro-Bell supporters realise it's probably more fluke then noteworthy. It just looks to me like people trying to make a statistic look like a fact, when if you put it into a broader picture, it's nothing signifigant. I'd wager on most jurys in the Parish, white or black criminal, one of the jurors can be traced in some way back to the victim, and I doubt at MOST you'd need even a 3 people seperation to link it. Again, only 14,282 people total.	0

Also, in a formal debate, character attacks are considered bad form.  And prejudice certainly isn't considered an argument. In fact, it often causes one to believe and say things that are not true, as Wile has pointed out.  16:09, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)  (Me)Evidently, English is not your mother tongue, so I can forgive you in misunderstanding that """"Delete with prejudice"""" does not refer to you, but to the article. I have spent some time observing your efforts to create articles which lack the barest semblance of connection to current mathematical research, and to be extremely rude to other Wikipedians when they quite reasonably ask for reliable references and sources. What I know of your work tells me that, even if there is some sense to what you posit, it lacks any context with which to connect to contemporary mathematical thought. It therefore constitutes, at best original research, which is explicitly unacceptable here, and at worst, what I will call delusional thought. It therefore has, in my opinion, no place in Wikipedia at this time, if ever. As I said earlier, call us after the Nobel is awarded.

I noticed a few things that I felt I had better ask you about before changing anything:  1) I noticed there was a section called """"Types"""" that contains only two sentences, and that the first of those is a repetition of a sentence I saw earlier at the end of the section headed """"Composition"""". I don't think the sentence needs to be repeated, but I didn't know which place was best for it.  2) The section on """"Etymology"""" starts with this sentence:  The etymology of the word gneiss is disputed.  but then we read of only one theory as to the origin of the word. If the etymology is disputed, shouldn't at least one other theory be given?  3) In the second paragraph in the section Gneiss#Gneissic banding, the word """"relatively"""" appears four times. I'm wondering whether all of them are necessary.  4) Regarding the images:  (a) I think they could be arranged better than they are. The first two images after the lead image are bunched close to the top. Wouldn't it be better if they were next to the sentences that mention those types of gneiss?  (b) The first image after the lead image mentions Augen gneiss from Brazil, but nowhere in the article does it say that gneiss is found in Brazil.  (c) The third image after the lead image mentions gneiss from New York State, but nowhere in the article does it say that gneiss is found in New York State. Also, there is no mention of gneiss found in New England or any of the western states.  (d) There is a whole section called Gneiss#Lewisian gneiss, and a whole section called Gneiss#Archean and Proterozoic gneiss, but there is no image of Lewisian, archean, or proterozoic gneiss.   I don't mind searching for images, but I don't know where to look and would need advice on uploading and licenses. -   """	0
13426	"""   Crocus olivieri istanbulensis   Dear Rivertorch,  This taxon is one on the three subspecies of Crocus olivieri. Its correct name is Crocus olivieri Gray subsp. istanbulensis B. Mathew. I have corrected it.   I hope the anonymous user will not change it again.  Best regards,  (To reply)   Hi Réginald. If you hadn't arrived on the scene, I was going to ping you. I removed the Turkish image and link, since I didn't think they were germane, but I left it to you to fix the taxonomic details. Does Mathew's classification, as it appears in the article, contain all the known species of crocus?     Hi River, The page contains all the recorded species, but not the infraspecific taxa (i.e., the numerous subspecies). Originally Crocus olivieri subsp. istanbulensis was for this reason not included. For consistency reason including it required to mention also -as I did- the two other subspecies olivieri and balansae. The issue is: if we want to be fully consistent we have to mention also all recorded subspecies (with their distribution as for that of C. olivieri?), among others the numerous subspecies of the variable C. biflorus. A niggling work! I am afraid that the page will become too scholastic. Your advice about this issue? Best regards,  (To reply)  PS: You can find a quite complete list of species and their subspecies on the NCBI taxonomy browser. Type """"Crocus"""" in the """"search for"""" bar.  (To reply)   Thanks for the link—that's a great resource. I don't think we should worry about its being too scholastic. My main concern would be with consistency: I'm not sure if there are comparable articles that also list all subspecies. The information about subspecies certainly should be available on Wikipedia, but should it go in the main article or in the more specific articles about each species (of which there are now only a few). I don't know.    For consistency reasons I have added the other subspecies reported in the NCBI taxonomy and cited the source. I agree that additional paragraphs or articles should be written for the most representative species, in which a detailed description of their subspecies would then be done (as e.g. I have done in fr:Crocus).  (To reply)  Okay. I'd be happy to help with creating new articles and refining translations, if you want to go that route. Just remember I don't know what I'm talking about ;-)      Dear River, I have removed again the the logo of the Sultanbeyli District Municipality, that User:Terzinator had added again to Crocus, explaining the reason for doing it (see User talk:Terzinator). Hopefully, he/she will not add it again! Best regards,  (To reply)  Thanks, Réginald. I don't do edit wars, so I'm glad there's someone else diligently watching the page.

150218	I agree with Travellingcari. The tags serve a useful purpose, even after the article is brought to AfD, and especially so when they have been on the article for a significant length of time. They make it clear to visiting editors that any interested parties have had a fair chance to improve the article, and hadn't, which is often a point used in support of deletion. Conversely, if the article isn't tagged, it's not clear that interested parties have been given a chance to improve the article, which may be used to support a keep argument. Removing the tag makes the status either way less clear. Yes, it's available in the history, but why make editors go through the extra work of checking the history? In addition, an AfD can end without reaching a consensus, which means the tag most likely still applies and would have to be restored. No, the time to remove the tag is after a consensus has been reached at the AfD that the subject does meet the notability guidelines, i.e. after it is closed with result keep (or in some cases, when the eventual outcome is clear per WP:SNOW).

You refuse to acknowledge overwhelming evidence. No sources say the NWPL was not responsible for having Sparks recognized, contrary to what you said. Conclusion: you are making things up. Stop misleading yourself and Wikipedia readers.         If your research skills are not limited, then your understanding of the facts, or willingness to read what I have provided, is.         Have you not read the study on park origins? What part of it don't you understand? If the NWPL was not responsible for the recognition of Sparks, then I challenge you, honestly with facts to support your argument, to demonstrate who was.         Below are two more articles to convince you of your egregious error, dare I say fabulation?        If you are not serving wikipedia's purpose of informing the public, then whose interest are you serving?        I dare you to continue denying the facts. Go ahead...     I note that you and other editors of Gatineau Park material are aviation enthusiasts...          - Sparks was founder of the park, researcher says,     - By Dave Rogers, Ottawa Citizen, May 9, 2004, p. A9    - Mackenzie King is often credited with founding the park, but an ex-journalist says Roderick Percy Sparks was the driving force, Dave Rogers reports.    - The NCC has hired a pair of Outaouais historians to study the origins of Gatineau Park after it received information that contradicts the popular notion that William Lyon Mackenzie King was the father of the park.    - The evidence, gathered by Chelsea resident and Senate speechwriter Jean-Paul Murray, suggests Roderick Percy Sparks played a far more influential role than the former prime minister in creating the park.    - Mr. Sparks dedicated 25 years of his life to the creation of a national park in the Gatineau Hills and for 10 years was chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League, a lobby group that encouraged the first government purchase of Gatineau Park.    - During the 1930s, Mr. Sparks and other members of the league argued there should be a national park in the Gatineau Hills because the widespread cutting of trees for firewood endangered the area's scenic beauty. The government created Gatineau Park in 1938, but it is not a national park and has no legal protection as a park.    - Mr. Sparks wrote the master plan for development of the park in 1952. The plan recommended that all private property in the area, including his home, be expropriated. Mr. Sparks' vacant house on Meech Lake Road in the park burned under mysterious circumstances in 2001 two months after Mr. Murray, the former managing editor of the federalist Cite libre magazine began asking questions about its owner.    - There was no electricity or combustible material, other than the building itself, to create a fire risk, nor was there evidence of fire starting from the nearby woods.    - No cause for the fire was ever made public. The police did not release a report and the report from the fire authorities was almost a blank. There was no cause, no suspects and no investigation.    - An obituary on Mr. Sparks in the Ottawa Journal of March 30, 1959 called him the “father of the Gatineau Park,” adding that as chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League, he “brought about the first purchase by the Dominion government of what is now the Gatineau Park.”    - Born in 1880, where the Supreme Court of Canada stands today, Percy Sparks was the great grandnephew of Ottawa pioneer Nicholas Sparks. He played a leading role in the customs investigation that led to the King-Byng Affair and to the subsequent defeat of the Liberal government. Mr. Sparks' contemporaries generally acknowledged him as the park's founder.    - “Percy Sparks was a giant who brought down Mackenzie King's government in 1926,” Mr. Murray said. """"He was the man who did more to create Gatineau Park than anybody else from lobbying to writing the first master plans.    - Mr. Murray said Mr. King was cautious about the creation of the park. “I found an interesting passage in his diary from 1937, a few months before the park was created, that showed he wasn't enthusiastic about the park because people might think he was trying to improve his property.”    - “The NCC says that he was one of the major architects of the park, but this disproves it.”    - Mr. Murray said the NCC never mentioned Mr. Sparks' role in creating the park so people wouldn't be tempted to advocate it"	0
66714	"""   About the topic ban of Wilhelmina Will from DYK   I've been trying to figure out what happened with the AN/I report that led to a topic ban for WW. Normally, when the community makes a decision that requires admin tools to implement or enforce, there is a closing administrator. I've reviewed the report and have summarized it at User:Abd/Will ANI incident (at this point, this is a long summary, not a short one, I will prepare a short version if it's later needed.) And I just realized that there never was a close to that report, which explains why WW wasn't informed, that would normally be a task undertaken by a closing admin. Now, you later described the report as a consensus to topic ban, and you did inform WW, but you reported it passively, as if it had not been your decision, you were just the messenger.  I easily understand how it happened, and assume nothing but good faith on your part, but there was a fundamental error here. The community does not make decisions by vote. Rather, it uses agents, public servants, who make decisions after review of community comment, but the servants are responsible for reviewing the arguments, and vote count isn't the issue except as a very rough guide, and I've seen many decisions, made by highly competent administrators, which ran directly contrary to a large majority of votes, based on a review of the arguments.  So I'm asking you if you did this. Did you review the arguments and decide that they were cogent and that a topic ban was in the best interests of the project. If you did not, would you do so now and """"close,"""" i.e., take personal responsibility for the decision? In which case you could then inform us as to the length of the ban, or any other conditions imposed. And there would then be, if another administrator wishes to lift the ban, a responsible admin to contact?  I will tell you that my now much more detailed review of the facts leads me to the conclusion that a ban wasn't justified at all, there was no disruption at DYK from Wilhelmina Will, and there was very minor misbehavior elsewhere which only gets connected with DYK because of her presumed motive. A general conclusion from those who understand DYK seems to be that there is nothing wrong with the motive, and that what WW did was simply some minor foolishness, of a kind that would normally pass almost unnoticed, and which she has not continued. So, in spite of her seeming disregard of warnings, she clearly hasn't disregarded them, she just quietly complied. Yes, she should learn to respond, it would help. But I have never seen a response to a warning as being a condition for not blocking. The procedure is Warn. Wait for repeated offense. Block if repeated. Not Warn. Wait for promise to comply. Block if no promise.  There were several issues raised: Mesodermchelys misbehavior: short term, over one or two days, 2 improper reverts to preserve word count. 3 edit summaries that express her personal reaction to Blechnic  which, after reviewing what he had done, I fully understand and sympathize with. She was foolish to make those edit summaries, but it wasn't disruptive, and it wasn't personal attack within the meaning given at WP:NPA, whereas she was under repeated PA within that meaning: an attempt to damage her reputation. Copyright violations. Evidence was requested at ANI, but none was provided, links were given by Blechnic that showed nothing of the kind. He is now attempting to build a case on his Talk page  he now refers to all of her edits as crap, later amended to vandalism  and what he cited was a sentence in a seven-month-old article which, it turns out, she had noticed in the Sandbox and asked an admin if she could use it, and she failed to check for copyvio. The sentence was a direct copy. Maybe. Or was it that a web site later took the sentence from Wikipedia? I certainly don't know. Easy to fix. No pattern shown. Incivility. But the example given, as far as I recall, was always back to the Mesodermochelys incident. And then reference was made to her lying about it, claiming that her leetspeak comment was really a note to herself about something else. This was a clumsy excuse that simply shows that she is naive. And which was harmless, except to her own reputation. Accuracy of her articles. She has made mistakes. However, what I've seen with WW articles on scientific subjects is that, particularly if they are DYK nominated, whatever errors are in them are rapidly fixed. The articles aren't an obstacle to the creation of accurate content, rather they facilitate it, particularly by being DYK nominated. In other words, if there is, in fact, a problem here, DYK is part of the solution, not part of the problem. But, in fact, her articles are much better than the average new article on Wikipedia.

4360	I was requested to provide an opinion here by ComfyKem. Everyone agrees that virus species and genera are inherently different. Usual practice for a genus with a single species would be to construct a single article to cover both, and that's sensible where the pair would otherwise duplicate each other. However, there's no reason in principle why each can't have an article  as long as there is sufficient distinctive, reliably sourced material in each to merit that. This appears to be the case here, just about (though bloating the Lloviu virus article with speculative information about what the virus particle might look like appears unhelpful). If we are to have a single article on a genus with a single species, as Plantdrew suggests, it would probably be best to have it at the species name, as that is what the bulk of readers are most likely to search for.	0

It is also very obvious from the maps, that such a configuration could only be built after major reconstruction in the area immediately south of the existing buildings, including the demolition of the power station and the taxiway overpass as well as parts of the air cargo building. It seems extremely unlikely that the plans ever called for such a comprehensive destruction of buildings from earlier expansion phases of the same plans. The historic urban planing maps also show no sign of an expansion of the airport beyond the current boundaries of its grounds.

Also, remember that there is a difference between claiming descent from the """"Israelites"""" and actually claiming to be practicing Judaism.  Here are the links you keep using to illustrate your points, and that you added to the article:   Anglo-Israelism  Never claimed to be Jews, they claim that the English are the descendents of the lost tribes of Israelites.  Nowhere on their site do they claim to be Jewish or practicing Judaism. I do not think there is a good argument that these people are Jews in any way.  They can and are identified in the Ten Lost Tribes article.  Christian Identity  Weird choice.  They hate Jews, look at the text of the article, where they explicitly condemn Judaism as evil. Certainly not an alternative form of Judaism, nor are they Jews.  Talmidaism  A subset of Christianity, or possibly Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article.  Nazarene A subset of Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article  Messianic Judaism  Already in the article that you edited  Judaizing teachers  Refers to a movement of early Christians, not a current group.  This is like including Jews Harp in the list - it is a reference to a historical label, not a religion.  Jews for Jesus  Already in the article that you edited  Messianic Renewed Judaism  A minor subset of Messianic Judaism  Lost Ten Tribes  Not a religion, but another good place to put these sort of links  British-Israel-World Federation  See Anglo-Israelism  I am open to discussion on these, but do read through the article first.

44202	Richard Miniter is a failure and a loser, and doesn't deserve a wikipedia page. He's a minor right-wing hack who's never been able to hold down a job because he's generally too hung over or lazy to come into work before about two in the afternoon (and even then, he's stinking of booze). He's alienated the entire right-wing media community, too, by suing just about everyone; after his latest lawsuit against the Washington Times, he's never going to get a job again. What's more, he was never important enough to warrant a page to begin with. He's published a couple of unimportant books about terrorism which were mainly based on Google searches.

Okay, what does my verifiable assertion of Left-wing bias say about my POV? Does it say that I'm some sort of redneck, ignorant or something like that? Maybe Liberal opinions are the majority where you live or go to church, but in the larger picture they are a small minority. 1 billion Christians believe the way I do and a around 100 million Christians in the United States do too. Does that make them an insignificant minority? I think its sad that Wikipedia is threatened by perspectives that go against its orthodoxy, which is decidedly Liberal and decidedly secular.

Thanks, i would like this issue sorted, i have offered to create an orthodox and unorthodox section on diet in sikhism, i have presented the same scholars that where in the original article, that the editor cited himself, yet when i cited the same scholars to show that they themselves agree that their are passages against meat and many sects against it, the current editor of diet in sikhism again took it off. How can a person cite a scholar and then reject my use of the same scholar when it doesnt fit in with his own POV, which he stated as only being orthodox. I know wiki also has information on Shia unorthodox sect of islam, does that mean we only adhere to one persons view on sikhism, when that person has cited sholars that openly admit that their are passages against meat, if that is the case then why cant relevant verses be shown?

134240	, 5 November 2007 (UTC)  I don't think I'm the one most in need of a lecture about not seeing the forest for the trees.  Look, Duk, if you want to take on the job of my reeducation, I can probably talk to you about it.    But if you want to do so, first we need a solid foundation on which to build the discussions.  Let's stick to what is known about why I was blocked, okay? JzG blocked me because I complained, in a point incidental to a separate complaint, on a complaints noticeboard, that Rlevse was rude and inconsiderate in his actions towards me.  We know that because JzG came right here and said that was why he was blocking me. Rlevse blocked me because I had not responded on Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts.  We know that because he came right here and said that was why he was blocking me. We also know it because Rlevse went to WQA and said that was why he was blocking me. Rlevse did not go and make any such explanation at Wikipedia talk:Call a spade a spade. Rlevse did not go and make any such explanation at User talk:ArielGold  Now, maybe I just missed it, but I don't think there is anything at Wikipedia:Blocking policy saying that the decision to block is something entirely at the administrator's whim, or that the administrator should Block now.  You can always invent a reason for it later. or anything along those lines.  So let's just stick with what is actually known and knowable about he reason for which I was blocked, the things that had been documented and recorded in our various histories here at Wikipedia before I was blocked.  Anything else is irrelevant.  Don't invent new reasons for a block.  At the same time, don't say that the stated reasons for a block were not the reasons for it.  For that matter, if Rlevse had wanted to take on that job, and had felt that there was something he wanted to teach me, he likewise could have tried to talk to me.  He did not do so.  If JzG had wanted to take on that job, he likewise could have tried to talk to me.  But he took it one step further than Rlevse did; JzG did make a comment addressed to something I said, but then he blocked me to prevent me from responding to his own comment.   22:13	0

It would sure be easier to keep them in check if WP:CRO templates were marked """"low importance"""" (and """"stub"""") by default, requiring manual input only for quality/importance upgrades. Speaking of which, if one wanted to adapt WP:Germany's version of the table depicting importance scale, where would one paste it at WP:CRO project's page? Should I just put it on talk page until we find a better place for it?   ([[User talk:Timbouctou|talk]])  From time to time I assess a couple of articles, and usually it's """"low"""" because these are easy to pick: villages, barely notable films and such. Yeah, it's a chore, but in this case occasional (or semi-permanent, to be honest) backlogs don't really hurt either... Well, the only proper place for the table is surely Wikipedia:WikiProject Croatia/Assessment, i.e. the assessment subpage (currently used for something slightly different, but this is easily fixable). Maybe the time to introduce it has come... I'm not sure myself, the project might offer an answer.    Just noticed you tried to add the quality scale... I've wrapped it in , which prevents it from messing up the main page. Not really a solution - ideally the assessment page and what is displayed in the Assessment frame should be entirely different things - but it works, kind of.      Re: Maps in infobox settlement   There's an intermediate template that you'd have to create, or use a parameter of the existing Template:Location map Croatia.

Henlein   I found out that while with Građanski Zagreb, the Austrian Karl Henlein was actually a coach/player. He is former Austrian international. Here (3rd paragraph) is says that Gradjanski had 2 Austrian internationals, refering to Henlein and probably Rupec. That makes me doubt if Jaroslav Šifer (Schiffer) ever got to play with Austria, as he played in this same period as well in the club, thus, if Sifer was Austrian international, they would have been 3, and not 2, as mentioned.

27041	"""First of all, the Gibson report is not a government report. Not that it matters, because stating that government reports are by nature reliable is ridiculous. Now, the reliability of any source can be questioned, which results in a discussion. This discussion is settled with arguments. It is not required that such arguments are themselves held to the same standard as the article text, so arguments being, for instance, original research, can be perfectly alright, as long as they are not cited in the article. On a talk page, we are not editors. MastCell is fundamentally wrong.    I'm sorry but I think both mast cell and the unregistered user misunderstand the issue here. JFW has expressed an intention to publish unsubtantiated, inflammatory claims which will be to the detriment of a patient community, from an unreliable source. Suzy Chapman and I have been trying to illustrate how unreliable the source is and how unsubstantiated the claims are. We have been providing copious evidence and plausible arguments as to why, but frankly it feels we are running around in circles. We are certainly not engaging in 'spurious arguments'. IF this goes ahead, the reputation of Wikipedia, Simon Wessely himself and possibly the Gibson may be severely damaged, because public calls for full verification will have to be made by the patient community, and Wikipedia's displayed determination to publish unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims from unreliable sources (NOT a government document). Suzy has attempted to resolve this problem by verifying the situation by Gibson himself via letter. But neither of us have suggested to phone up the subject on the phone: Sciencewatcher has. So already we have misreading of the facts being exhibited here.  But in addition there is a marked inconsistency here: all sorts of debate goes on at Wikipedia. Calling the discussion """"the din of argumentation, speculation, unverfiable personal commentary"""" DOES NOT MAKE IT SO just because you say. And just because you can't be bothered to study the points does not make the points irrelevant! I have developed quite a lot of familiarity with Wikipedia processes, and both Mast Cell and the unregistered user don't seem to be following them.

35962	""" Alan, I'm not sure what you think is compromised ... could you clarify? The core issue we are discussing relates to the template/contents of an Integral portal page that actually reflects the integral movement as it exists. AQAL is one author's (Ken Wilber's) name for his particular developmental model. It is already described in the wikipedia's Ken Wilber article and nobody has suggested that a separate page be added for it. The issue is whether thinkers who call themselves integral and are generally understood and acknowledged as """"integral thinkers"""", doing work that is called """"Integral Studies"""", can simply be identified in the Integral portal page as such, no matter what their particular sect or affinity, (which is all that I have suggested), or whether such thinkers need to be divided a priori into pro-Ken Wilber and anti-Ken Wilber camps, or """"Integral (AQAL)"""" and """"Integral"""", as it seems you may now be proposing. Obviously term AQAL (or even Wilberian for that matter) can be used inoccuously to describe Wilber's own writings. But how does a wikipedia editor decide that a work that calls itself integral (not AQAL) is not suitable for an integral portal page but only an AQAL portal? Even I did so once, as you noted. But it is quite another for a wikipedia editor to declare that certain thinkers or books cannot be linked or acknowledged at an integral portal but only an AQAL portal, based on some subjective interpretation of their use of elements of AQAL theories. I still do not see an answer for whether you would allow Robert Kegan into the integral portal or whether you would insist that he be listed under AQAL only, and I could ask the same question about dozens of writers who cite Wilber as one of many influences. Without a principled and objective answer, I think you are asking wikipedia editors to step into a totally untenable position. As I wrote earlier: ...usually thinkers use some aspect of Wilber's thought combined with the thought of many other sources, seldom use every feature of AQAL, and often disagree about key points. On what basis do you insist that people who call their thought integral actually be considered Wilberian? How much of Wilber's thought must one agree with to be so classified, and who decides? When you acknowledge that a thinker such as Robert Kegan has """"mutually influenced"""" Wilber and yet is part of the integral school of thought, would you propose to create a new Integral portal for such hard-to-classify thinkers, and segregate every thinker that displays too much affinity to Wilber or his model into a separate category, either explicitly called """"Integral theory (Wilberian)"""" or """"Integral theory"""" (but with the Wilberian association implicit, with a wikipedia editor such as yourself presumably determining whether every new thinker is sufficiently anti-Wilber to be listed in the main category)?  I have not proposed that AQAL be used as a synonym for integral at all, only that any thinker who describes their work as integral and is generally acknowledged as such by independent sources be listed or linked at the integral portal in an appropriate fashion. Since, perhaps, some 90% of thinkers describing themselves as integral today are influenced to one degree or another by Wilber, the consequence of using the term integral in a neutral, objective way as I have proposed may very well be that many themes and ideas treated at the integral portal will be connected to AQAL in some fashion. Again, I will say that in my opinion the right place for your concern about AQAL being inappropriately used as a synonym for integral is in reviewing the content of the pages rather than in denying the usefulness of an integral portal at all.

139998	"""   Ongoing IAU discussion?   Is the reason that there was no improved IAU definition of planets that they wanted to pass such a decision with a large majority, but couldn't come to an agreement yet? I hope it's not that they think the current definitions are OK, because they're clearly not. For example the definition of extrasolar planet states the lower mass limit for an object to be an extrasolar planet is the same as in the Solar System... but there was no such limit given. Neither for dwarf planets nor for regular planets. There would have been no harm done if the upper limit for extrasolar planets was also applied to the Solar System, but that wasn't done either. It's like they're hiding everything behind smoke and mirrors and make up the results as they go.  It would be relatively easy to come up with criteria that could decide if a newly discovered body is a planet or not. But they didn't do it. Why? What for example is wrong with the following? 1. A planetary mass object is an object with a mass between the agreed mass limit needed for hydrostatic equilibrium (5×1020kg) and the agreed mass limit needed for deuterium fusion (2.5×1028kg). (Both limits might be set lower since the first would exclude Pallas and Vesta which are remaining protoplanets and the second doesn't take into account that objects with high metallicity could allow deuterium fusion at a lower mass) 2. A planet is a planetary mass object on an orbit around at least one star that also has the capability of clearing its orbit (per Stern-Levison criteria. The difference is you only need to know mass and orbital period of the object (and the star of course), whereas with Soter's criteria you'd need to know everything about the system). 3. A dwarf planet (I prefer mesoplanet) is a planetary mass object on an orbit around at least one star that doesn't fulfill the Stern-Levison criteria.  More definitions could be added to account for other types of planetary mass objects. I prefer """"planetar"""" for those that don't orbit any star - regardless if they were formed by themselves or in a system of which they were later ejected. Also, I'd like """"moon"""" to mean a planetary mass object that orbits a planet (since the prototype object Luna is just that) - smaller bodies would just keep being """"satellites"""". (If you don't like to have 60 planets of which most are small, why would you allow 60 moons of which most are tiny?)  Any ideas why the IAU doesn't come up with something like that?     First of all, there is a lower mass limit: hydrostatic equilibrium. Second, this has nothing to do with improving the article. Simply talking about the merits or lack thereof of the IAU's decision is outside the scope of Wikipedia. podous  Your second point is right. My opinions are not relevant, as I'm not an astronomer, and my conclusions from the available data would be OR, so neither belongs in the article. But you don't seem to realize that your first point is extremely open to definition. It could mean the shape of the object. Then the next question is where the limit between spheroidal and irregular is. It could mean an object with this mass and composition would certainly reach hydrostatic equilibrium. Or it could mean an object with this mass would certainly reach hydrostatic equilibrium. I'm heavily in favour of the third, as it is the one that could be most easily checked (especially for exoplanets), and avoids the problem that an ice world could qualify, while a larger and denser asteroid would be rejected, since rocky worlds are much harder to pull into equilibrium. But from statements in the article, I'm guessing at least those astronomers favor the second one. (And if they're not representative, why would they be in the article?)Basically, I want to say that the IAU should make a decision that makes it clear the astronomers know what they are doing and want to share their knowledge with the public. Because if the public decides to not follow astronomers' findings anymore, the result will likely be even less funding... and that would be a real problem.     There are many ambiguities with the current definition, all of which are mentioned in the article already. podous 13:29, 19 Januar"	0

135249	Creating subarticles as needed to bring this article to a usable length   Currently, Monsanto is WAY too long to be reasonably useful as a general encyclopedia article, and much of the content, which at times goes into great detail on specific topics, would be better served in subarticles.  It is well over 25,000 words of readable copy (reference section excluded), which is approaching three times the recommendation in WP:SIZE. In practical terms, at an average reading rate of 200-250 wpm, it's in the region of a 2-hour read.  Compounding the problem, about 80% of the article is a poorly organized mix of product descriptions, and related political, legal and social issues and information. This is as challenging for editors as it is for readers, because it is hard to locate if and where particular details are covered.  On the positive side, the article's introduction is concise, readable, and seems to cover the key points - history, business, social - quite well. (A strictly length-constrained direct expansion of the intro would probably result in a good main article.)  Creating subarticles is an established, quick, and relatively straightforward way to address this problem<, requiring simply moving existing subsections to their own article pages and replacing them with, initially at least, the briefest of summaries that can later be expanded and refined as necessary, along with Main article redirect tags.  Based on the current article structure, the following subarticles suggest themselves:  Monsanto#Legal_actions_and_controversies > Monsanto legal actions and controversies Monsanto#Products_and_associated_issues > Monsanto product issues  With summary content for the two daughtered subsections, this would bring the article to an easy-to-navigate 9,000 or so words.  Of course, this isn't a magic bullet solution, but it will immediately bring the article to a usable length, while hopefully avoiding a breakout of contentious editing and edit warring in the main article, at least, by directing the editing of issue details to the subarticles (which could use a thorough reorganization).	0

82907	Holby series/characters   Hi there, I know you've been doing a fair bit of contributing to the various Holby City series and character pages recently. I see you've been adding various wards after character's names and job titles, though I think it's got to a point where the lists are tending to look a little cluttered. As the editor who added the character lists to the individual series pages in the first place, the intention was to only include the ward that each characters usually appeared on - the one they were resident on - rather than just the wards that they popped up on from time to time. As such, this is why I've been keeping characters such as Guy Self and Colette Sheward in the list without a ward, as they do not appear to be formally allocated to a particular ward. Where there have been multiple wards listed, this has been due to the characters moving between wards over the course of the series, such as recently when Ric Griffin and Michael Spence swapped roles on Keller and AAU, respectively, during Series 15, hence their listing there as Keller/AAU and AAU/Keller.  As such, I'm proposing, for brevity's sake, as well as for clarity, that the wards listed be kept to a minimum - each character's principal ward only, rather than any that they occasionally appear on (for argument's sake, pretty much all characters appear on AAU from time to time, but that doesn't mean they should have AAU listed after their names). The alternative is that we do away completely with having characters' wards listed after their names. I've reverted the list to its former appearance, in the process removing a couple of things (Dominic isn't on AAU, Edward (who, incidentally, left the show in Episode 13, and has been removed from the opening titles and the BBC website) wasn't on Keller, and Nathan and Mr Thompson were never given allocated named wards).  Let me know what you think - it may be that the complete removal of wards may be the easiest way forward!	0

62796	"""   Republic of Korea   It's irritating to that this page is titled """"South Korea"""", which is nothing more than a regional designation. Maybe a page on the unique geographical or cultural/historical happenings on the southern part of the Korean peninsula would be accurately named, but there doesn't seem to be a good reason not to redirect to Republic of Korea. China, for instance, isn't the page name for the People's Republic of China. There are plenty of other counter examples, of course, Japan being the name of the page for the State of Japan, or Zimbabwe for the Republic of Zimbabwe, or a dozen others, but these names are so close to their formal names as to only designate the form of government. Because of the DPRK and ROK's mutual use of the term 'Korea', this isn't a satisfactory alternative. """"South Korea"""" reads increasingly anarchronistic, a vestigal designation from the Korean war when the difference between the two countries was most importantly location-geographic in the sense of military holdings, and a division which was supposed to be temporary.

11284	"""   Question for Gwen Gale   Gwen, I'm asking you this question mainly because of your frequent participation at this article and its talk page. Would you consider material presented from this source acceptable and helpful if used in a proper context? Thanks.    My question was asked in good faith. Perhaps you could find some time to answer it. Thanks.     The only answer I can give to an open question like this is, please do see WP:RS (it's where I'd look first if I had a broad question about a source). If you'd like further input on a given citation, lots of editors other than myself watch this page, you might want to post it here and see what that stirs up, that's what article talk pages are all about. You can also try Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard, which at least may sometimes give one something akin to a further take on neutrality.    Thanks, Gwen, for getting back to me. Obviously others are welcome to give further input concerning the source I asked you about. I was curious as to what your opinion was regarding The Sun as a reliable source. I read an interesting article given by Rochus Misch there.    Misch himself didn't see everything and recall can get way fuzzy after six and a half decades, but he saw a lot nonetheless. Could you post a link to that article here? I'd be happy to read it. Thanks.    Sorry, Gwen, for the delay in getting back to you. I actually was hoping for your opinion about """"The Sun"""" rather than about Misch. If I decide to add the information at some later point we might be able to discuss its relevancy at this talk page. For now, your opinion regarding using The Sun as a source would be appreciated.    I'm sorry, I had missed this. I would need to see the article itself. That said, I'd be wary of citing anything from the Sun without knowing who wrote it and how it was sourced by them. Moreover, if I found something in the Sun I'd tend to dig deeper and find a source on which one could more steadfastly lean. It's not that tabloids get things wrong (all newspapers botch details, all the time) so much as tabloids tending to over-spin stuff for entertainment, which is their slice of the market, in much the same way the Times and the Guardian spin heavily for politics in some topic areas. It all makes for sloppiness, through which a cite may, say, be ok as to WP:V but then skids into the ditch owing to WP:UNDUE.    I wonder if this relates. I would think it would be wrong to reference, edit, or dispute sources which are not at hand to be checked. Perhaps a person should only use information that they have read and can understand.   Wm, I doubt that only  """"using information that they have read and can understand"""" would be the best criterion to use and be the most appropriate and helpful method in referencing an encyclopedia. Being partial to an exopedian version of this project (I do err from time to time myself), I think the inclusion of """"quotes"""" and anecdotal reminiscences gleaned from border line tabloids should be avoided.    I lost you, but I’m confused myself. It appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.  The U.S. is big on free press, and it works.

115235	"""   Origin of the theory of Liszt's """"piano revolution""""   The theory of Liszt's revolutionising piano playing was apparently an invention of Lina Ramann. She had in November 1876 asked Liszt whether his """"Umwälzung der Klaviertechnik"""" (""""Revolution of piano technique"""") had been due to Paganini's Caprices. on December 1 Liszt wrote to this that it was his biographer who had to decide, since he himself was unable to take an objective point of view towards his foolish own productions. It was his only consolation that they could have become even worse after all.  Lina Ramann's """"decision"""" can be found in her Franz Liszt als Künstler und Mensch, Erster Band, Zweites Buch, p.106. According to this, Liszt's hands had been rather small and could hardly stretch a 9th. From Paganini's Caprices, according to Ramann, Liszt took the idea how to play wider intervals, and this was his entire """"revolution"""". Ramann's theory is of course wrong. There were others who wrote wide intervals as well (for example Schumann, Chopin, Henselt, Thalberg, Döhler, Dreyschock and many further ones). To this comes that the theme of Liszt's Clochette-Fantasy was not taken from Paganini's Caprices, but from a violin concerto, and that there are no extraordinarily wide intervals in this particular piece. It is to be presumed that Liszt himself read Ramann's theory with astonishment.85.22.19.160  """	0

In return, it received prices of almost 25 cents over the American selling price from the desparate Soviet foreign trade organization responsible for grain imports, Export Khleb. In addition, Export Khleb wooed Argentina into an agreement to sell 20 million tons of corn and grain sorghum, and 2.5 million tons of soybeans to the Soviets over the next five years.

86879	Editor Interaction Analyzer   Thanks for your great analyzer, but there seems to be an issue that you might want to check. There is a discussion at WP:ANI where user X claims user Y is hounding them, and Y asked what tool could be used to check what pages they had both edited. I thought I would check that using a couple of tools. I forget why (I might have been wondering about the differences from what I saw in your tool and Intersect Contribs), but I decided to use some local text massaging of the raw data from each user's contribs.  Compared with Interaction Analyzer, my  found 16 extra pages (including 7 extra articles) edited by both users this year (from 2012-01-01). For example, Madurai (history) is not on your list. That might have something to do with the fact, as mentioned by your tool, that one of the users has over 50,000 edits? This is just FYI, no need for a reply.	0
144708	"""   List of USN ships   Hello, I've been doing some updating and correcting on the article List of current ships of the United States Navy. I see that you contributed a great deal to article previously. At one point, with about a half dozen edits, you added 24 ships to the section """"Ready Reserve Force ships"""". You listed them all as belonging to the Cape Ducato class, however that is a class of only 5 ships. I'm wondering if you had other info that stated these other 19 ships were considered a part of that class? If not, then if you have some free time, would mind stopping by the article and help correct this? From what I've (briefly) read, most of these ships are from various sources, builders and countires. Some are listed as """"Type C7 ships"""", while others don't have any such designation. Anyway, any help help you could provide would be appreciated. -  '''' """	0
69664	""", 8 July 2006 (UTC)  Hank Williams didn't listen to too many of their records. He was a country boy and was influenced by swing music, yet he recorded pure rockers. Country music played as much a vital roll in the formation of rock n roll than black music, no matter how some people wish to deny it. Bill Haley, The Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly and many more of the greatest rockers had their roots in country. Chuck Berry was also influenced by it and , if he had been white, would have probably been seen as Country, rather than R&B.; Elvis is allowed to be called """"The King"""", just as much as, say James Brown is allowed to be called """"The hardest working man in showbiz"""", you don't see people who dislike him throwing everything but the kitchen sink in to try and make out it was a """"marketing"""" ploy and their favorite artists worked harder.  02:29"""	0

67176	And I would very much like to know who you think you are and who appointed you on that page? For your knowledge Meru was officilly placed here to watch this talk page by mediator Nicholas Turnbull, and this talking is in the process on entering the arbitation comity, so your interventions here are so outplaced as they can be! I talked with Nicholas Turnbull tonight who disagree with your actions. You are not appointed here and do not have to make decisions above the heads of the members of the arbitration comity, so you will be very kind to step aside and anihilate your previous doing. This is not your playground. I do not know what are your motives to acting as you do as nobody has ever seen you here, but you do seems to go at it with a revenge. Any reasons who would be worth mentioning now? You have just been elected admi and the first thing you do is blocking and banning fox from a site you don't know and that you were not aware of for 24 hours ago. This don't go, you are overstepping wikis rules and previously made decision about this talkpage. You are acting very unbalanced and provocating a chaos who wasn't there before and who in fact wasn't there as far as the 22th of september. Isn't your role to make things work?  Another veru very important thing is that you are walking on my article about a Settlement Proposal, that I do recommend you to read carefully, and that you don't have answer to in your recents edits above, and who therefor have no place what so ever under my article and as a part of it. So moove your articles above, to follow suite of your childrens fights, and leave the growing up doing the right thing. This article above was the one I was writng and in fact inserted in Meru own talk page before you made your intrance here, and before the situation degenerated that much. I did it in an attempt to calm tempers down and create a new tangible goal with better opportunity to solve this dilema than revert war and banishments war. I was stopped at inserting my article by constant editing of article from people fighting, and had each time to perform some changement of my article before saving it, at the end it was too late, you hade arrived, talk like césar, ban a person wihtout valuable and argued explainations, without warning, and taken over the role assignated to Meru by N. Turnbull a few days ago.  By the time I arrived to save my article about burrying the hachet, heads had already rolled, thanks for you. For your knowledge, you did it at midnight, a saturday evening, and this kind of action will have required the presence of more users, and an agreement between those. Your opinion about the presence of Igor or not on his talkpage is none of your business, but the business of the arbitration comity and their decision, not yours. You will have to be more patient and leave to other the right to decide. Know your chain of command, and the wikis appointed chain of event before a ban can take place, specialy a definitiv ban! What about the other guy who begin this reverting phase all together? isn't he guilty as well or is he your personnal friend in the discussion forum? For if this is the case, and if you do have preferences for who is right and who is wrong, so you shouldn't be here and make interventions as well. You have to stay neutral, but your judgement sounds arbitrary to me, to the point that even your collegue Meru didn't understood what and why you were doing this and disagreed. Why are you making troubles, and tell me why the alone person who support your actions, is rjb, the exact person known for insulting peoples very often, reverting all the time, and having started this reverting war completely iognoring previous concensus made about the contain of the biography on this talk page. He was destroying the work of people, to who it had taken several weeks to obtain. You didn't baned him, why? Is he your socket puppet, or are you his? What were you doing 6 hours ago and why did you came here? Did someone warned you? What triggered your hush at coming by, first time, so late? I would very much like to know.  You will please move your dispute and different blowings up on one another on a different place, and will take your bad saturday night mood swing somewhere else than on this talkpage, unless you have a satisfactory explaination for what just did happened. You can't ban Igor when Holger Beck Nielsen is going to make an intervention on this talk page. I hope you know who this person is. i do notice that the 2 persons who made reverting a war, and insisted on it are ybm and rjb who are both in very close contact with each other, and in fact I am quiet sure that rjb is The socket puppet of YBM.

Richard Barrett in a published interview alluded to this affair, believing the rejection of his article was owing to bias.  What is more, practically no major younger figures of the New Complexity were included among the published articles, whereas, for instance, Erik Ulman, who is a very fine composer but not a New Complexity composer, was included. Whatever the reasons for the choice of articles, the failure to include major younger figures associated with the New Complexity seriously skewed this entire """"Forum.""""  Secondly, I would beg you to not play childish games by removing composers I have posted. You have done fine work on Stockhausen, but you are by no means an expert on the subject of New Complexity. I have not seen a single article of yours focusing on this subject. I have never seen you at any of the festivals in which numerous works of younger composers associated with the New Complexity were performed, such as the bludenzer tage of the 1990's of the Züricher Tage of the early 1990's.  Why would you dare to remove Wolfram Schurig, co-editor of the primary book series focused on the New Complexity, leader of the bludenzer tage in its most daring period, and composer commissioned by leading ensembles throughout Europe?  If you don't know anything about him, this reflects badly on your claim to be an expert in this field.  Why would you remove Klaus K. Hübler, whose influence on New Complexity composers is clearly stated in multiple articles in the New Music and Aesthetics in the 21st Century series. Marc André has received numerous prestigious awards and commissions, and his work has also been closely associated with New Complexity; one need only read his articles appearing in the New Music and Aesthetics series to find support for this assertion.  I would strongly suggest that you do your homework in this field before you go about arbitrarily altering the contributions of others.  You could begin by going through the first six volumes of the New Music and Aesthetics series, then read numerous articles in Musik & Âsthetik (several references that appeared earlier in this entry have been removed) and works by Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf and others.  Then visit several dozen festival in Europe over an extended period. Then do some score study, perhaps beginning with the composers whose names you have removed.  """	0

Having said that, the expert POV by PressTV does even employ the term """"anti-Imperialist"""" verbatim to describe the Houthis. Russia Today also suggests that the struggle is part of the post-colonialist movements' struggle against imperialists and colonialists. Likewise, the author in the linked paper from Taylor & Francis identifies the same anti-imperialist themes in Hussein al-Houthi's thoughts. Furthermore beyond these sources, the very fact that Houthis' antagonists are well-known to be in alliance with the living reality of US Imperialism and the blatant reality of the ongoing war against Yemen are themselves obvious clues reaffirming the nature of the struggle by the Houthis as being anti-Imperialist in nature. Houthi leaders have also numerously stressed that they are aspiring for independence from foreign influence (namely US and Saudi) as already mentioned in the article.

This phenomenon was mitigated with the passing of legislation by the Croatian government banning Ustasha symbols and associated references.  The reasons for the change include:  There is no evidence of resurgence in ideology, but lots of evidence of increase use of symbology especially around areas that suffered heavy casualties and devastation during the war - thus the adjustment to reflect this fact;  No evidence of paramilitaries adopting the ideology - I do not count HOS in that group who had a Party of Rights agenda as opposed to an Ustasha agenda - often the two get confused as the same b/c the Ustasha was an offshoot of the party of rights and there was some crossover in political goals e.g. independent Croat state; notion of historical territory ;  No mention of anti-hate speech legislation and the ban of Ustasha symbols - included mation of this in intro.	0

136794	"""  An added remark in my article that will please Makemi a lot To prove  that I do not have any interest in praising this new CEUS computer piano, I add the following remark in my article: """"Bösendorfer has a reputation of excellence at piano making. Moreover, German-speaking countries such as Austria have a tradition of excellence at anything related to solving complex engineering tasks. And lastly, Austria is in Europe and the way products are advertised in Europe is much more honest than the way they are advertised in the USA (features of products mentioned by European companies are nearly always true contrary to what happens in the USA!). Consequently, there is no reason to doubt that the features that Bösendorfer mentions on their web site concerning this new CEUS Computer Grand Piano will prove to be true when they will be assessed by independent parties.""""  So, here is the new, latest version of my article; it should pleased even the worst complainers and prove that I am with no agenda at all!! The New (2006) Bösendorfer Reproducing Grand Piano: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano During the past recent decades, a reproducing piano (also sometimes called a computer piano or a player piano) has been defined as being first an acoustic piano that is not diminished in any way in its ability to play piano pieces. The touch at the keyboard and the sound produced by a reproducing piano is not changed in any way compared to a normal acoustic piano. However, a reproducing piano has an unobtrusive computer interface that allows the pianist to record and playback the piano pieces that are performed on it. Usually, it also has a silent mechanism that stops the hammers from striking the strings and that allows the pianist to play silently at the keyboard, at any time during the day or the night without disturbing others, and with the option of using headphones to hear digital sounds while playing silently at the keyboard (many digital sounds are available: piano, harpsichord, organ, strings, etc.). It also has a MIDI interface that allows the pianist to play back many pieces that are available on this particular MIDI format. The capability of a reproducing piano to convey the full expressiveness of the pianist at the keyboard is directly related to its ability to record and playback accurately the velocity of the hammers that are moved when the pianist presses the keys at the keyboard. However, the MIDI format allows the recording and playback of the velocity of the hammers of the piano only at a level of accuracy of 127 scales (or 127 steps if you prefer). The problem is that most of the pianistic techniques move the hammers at an incredibly high speed, making these 127 scales highly insufficient to be able to record and playback accurately the very high velocity of the hammers. Consequently, a reproducing piano usually also has a more accurate proprietary format to record and playback piano pieces at a much higher level of accuracy than the MIDI format. In summary, a reproducing piano is a very flexible musical instrument that combines the old (an acoustic piano) with the new (a MIDI format but especially the recording and playing back of the piano) at the same time. It allows the pianist to play the numerous MIDI piano pieces available but, more importantly, to record and playback piano pieces at a higher level of accuracy than it is possible to do with the MIDI format.  The quality of the Bösendorfer pianos and especially the sound that they produce are the result of a long and old tradition of piano making.  Bösendorfer also kept in touch with modernity. They took an active participation at making reproducing pianos first with their SE 290 computer piano that was made in collaboration with Wayne Stahnke. It was considered by the entire community of piano makers to be the most accurate reproducing piano of its time. At the beginning of 2006, Bösendorfer introduced its next generation of reproducing pianos: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano.  Previously to the Bösendorfer CEUS Computer Grand Piano, several scientific studies were made that had for main goal to assess if the reproducing pianos that were available were as faithful to the expressiveness of the best performers at the piano as they should be. These studies concluded that the best reproducing pianos (including the SE 290 computer piano) were not as faithful at recording and playing back the performance of the best pianists as they should have been (see in particular """"Measurement and reproduction accuracy of computer-controlled grand pianos"""" by Werner Goebl, et al., August 6-9, 2003).  Taking this conclusion as an incentive to raise the accuracy of its reproducing piano (the SE 290 computer piano), Bösendorfer set themselves to create an even more accurate reproducing piano that would accomplish THE VERY CHALLENGING GOAL OF BEING ABLE TO RECORD AND P"	0

First revert is actually changing a paraphrase of the source into a direct quote of the source, while eliminating references to primary sources (eg, I Corinthians) bolstering POV arguments of the editor, not relying on secondary sources. 2nd & 3rd """"reverts"""" are actually an accommedation to the removal of the citation of the primary source by moving the table displaying the primary sources including the Corinthians source in context in parallel columns [originally produced by me four years ago] higher in the article to allow readers to decide for themselves what the primary source said]. """"revert"""" 4 eliminate a redundancy in another New testament reference covered by the table as well as an unsourced claim and is not a reversion. """"revert"""" 5 is simply not a reversion, is an attempt to flesh out a paraphrase of a source, from the source, a point which I actually don't agree and it's not my point of view, nor I think the point of view of that person making the complaint.  In addition, the complainant is required to document his attempt to work it out on the talkpage which he has not done. You've tried to resolve this edit war on the article talk page, haven't you? So put a link to the discussion here. If all you've done is reverted-without-talk, you may find yourself facing a block too > Diff of attempt to resolve dispute on article talk page: [diff]  My repeated attempts to get other editors to discuss content, talkpages have the perverse result of being used against me.  I used the term, editors, when there's really only one other editor, Esoglou, who is currently under sanction, and who used to be sanctioned under the handle LimA.  Lionelt's involvememnt stems from a cry for allies at the Christiannity noticeboard:  Origin of the Eucharist   History2007 has referred above to a past problem with the article Origin of the Eucharist.  The problem is again as acute as ever.  Only two editors are active in opposing the lone editor about whose apparent aims I say nothing.  I would be grateful if editors with greater knowledge than I have about Wikipedia rules would give advice.  One solution with which I am toying is to let the lone editor have free rein, so that nobody then reading the article would take it seriously.      One thing I am not sure about is this. Does Eschoir have a possible WP:COI issue there? That may be one way to resolve it. As I said before, I have 1,500 pages on my watchlist, so I can not get involved in details there right now, and that is why we need a general 9-1-1 call system or a Mayday button (perhaps built into the WikiProject Christianity banner) as Lionel suggested so editors can be called for help.    What an interesting idea: add it to the banner. Well, if you like the """"Click here in case of emergency"""" button I just added to the top of this talk page, it should be relatively easy to add the button to the banner. It would take a consensus, of course, and we'd want to coordinate with John's redesign of the banner. – Lionel (talk)  Lionelt has helped very much, and I express my appreciation.  As for Eschoir, I think he just enjoys stirring others up.  In the past, another favourite target of his was Free Republic (see the archived talk pages).

I have reviewed all of the materials, and it appears some individuals participated, but they clearly did not have the consent or backing of the Paiute tribe as a whole.  The mormons did it, its verified, their dishonesty about the affair is a matter of verifiable public record, I do not see where any other debates are necessary on the matter of the cultural identity of the victims or the involvement of the Paiute Tribe.	0

118703	"""  Okay...it's not cool for people to keep moving the article back and forth.  We should agree on a single solution before anyone moves forward with any major action.  I am personally for the """"Fourth International (United Secretariat)"""" title because, while I am generally (not officially) a supporter of the FI, I recognize that there is some historical ambiguity, and am seriously interested in the neutrality question here on Wikipedia.  When you mention the FI, you are invariably asked """"which one?""""  And the truth is that """"United Secretariat"""" will always answer the question.  I feel that it's different from titling the article """"United Secretariat of the Fourth International,"""" which is misleading, as that's the now-defunct body that directed the FI for 40 years.  We're disambiguating, because """"Fourth International"""" is touchy ground for Trotskyists outside of the FI (you know which one).  """"Reunified Fourth International"""" isn't used by anybody.  """"Fourth International (1963)"""" posits a 1963 founding that didn't really happen.  """"Fourth International (United Secretariat)"""" is also parallel to Fourth International (ICR), where the organization identifies itself as """"The Fourth International"""" but the article uses a no-longer-present body to disambiguate it.  Any move at this point is going to be, in some respect, not entirely neutral in its point of view.  Given that reality, I think that recognizing convention and using the United Secretariat, while clearly explaining the nomenclature issues up front in the article, remains the best way to present the FI as it has been since 1963.

8878	"""  Some of these things I have already changed or deleted. A province really does not have a monetary policy (though it can do some things e. g. about the availability of cash) and the phrase was too general to begin with, so that's gone. I changed """"did nothing to stop"""" to """"did not work to stop"""", though your criticism is valid. Note however that, when De la Rúa took office, Argentina was already in recession or on the brink of it, and the government concentrated on contractive measures from the start. Then came the corralito, etc. On the whole, the measures were intended to stop the collapse of the economy and all the economic analysts and the IMF were recommending them. I don't remember any major economist recommending an alternative course of action. Note also that """"economic collapse"""" doesn't refer only to the critical period November 2001 - February 2002, but to the whole recessive period (1999-2002) and some time before and after. We should agree on a phrase that links De la Rúa's measures with the crisis without falling into any of: """"... did not work to stop the economic collapse."""" """"... ended up precipitating the economic collapse."""" """"... ultimately caused the economic collapse."""" """"... were intended to cause the economic collapse."""" (!!) """"... had nothing to do with the economic collapse"""" (!!!) Then the """"import-dependent"""" thing. Consider this: right after the devaluation, neighboring countries had to help us get medicine. The public hospital where I worked initially could not get X-ray film from the providers, and then only by paying in cash (and in dollars). Argentina then and still now is incapable of sustaining economic growth without importing certain forms of technology. I'd say that's rather import-dependent, though we may be speaking of different things. What do you propose? What's the problem with the religious aspects of the Supreme Justices? The previous justices were all old, male, and ideologically conservative, and in addition some had ties to the right wing of the Catholic Church. And now two of them are women, one is the president of the Court and the other is a militant atheist in her own words. The clarification is intended to show the reader that the changes introduced in the Supreme Court were really important. Argibay's atheism in particular was even reported as a salient fact in international media. In a country where the Church attacks anyone who dares speak of women's rights, having these two women at the top of one of the country's government branches is extremely significant. The qualification """"historical"""" for the payment to the IMF is that (correct me if I'm wrong) Argentina had never decided to pay so much to the IMF or anyone else, not only at the same time but also ahead of schedule; and this payment has re-defined the relationship of Argentina with the IMF and swept with many assumptions about the economic future of the country that were valid before the payment. I'm glad we're discussing this here civilly. Understand that no-one here is (that I know) affiliated with a party or a person (if someone is, it doesn't show), and that we don't have an ideological police, or a bureaucracy that you have to go through before correcting what you believe is wrong in an article; but when an article is not very new and deals with an important topic, you have to consider that most of the content is """"settled"""" already and should be treated carefully, to avoid being (or being seen as) disruptive.

40975	You probably noticed that the stl template can now be used to group articles under a number of various working groups.  I've been working through Category:Unassessed St. Louis articles and slowly rating and sorting articles.  Generally, the work is pretty easy, but i do have a problem with certain businesses, musuems, parks, and other minor things.  They don't specifically belong to of the working groups I made, and I am very reluctant to begin new working groups because there are already way too many.  The education group, which is shaping up nicely is a bit overloaded.  I'm trying to decide if I should group all the museums under them or not.  Musuems may also be categorized under buildings and structures and therefore architecture, and some of them can fall under History.  I made a proto-list at List of museums in Greater St. Louis which seems like a useful place to work from, but should I really make a museums working group?  Alternately I could just leave all the museums without a group and just let them fall under the general wikiproject.  What are your thoughts?	0

It is an accurate portrayal of one of those conflicting points of view.   (talk)   Ah, yes, but we probably need a quotation from another view that conflicts it. Would anyone be able to find one? |heru|nar   Some comments regarding France's utter defeat in the Napoleonic Wars should be part of the article, nonetheless. The fact that France slipped from being the top European power to a secondary level, clearly below Britain's and soon also below Germany's and even Austria's, is hardly contentious. It must be remembered that the Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars came hard on the heels of what appeared to Europe's intellectuals as Britain's final, unavoiding loss of great power status, following the independence of the U.S. (just six years before the assault on the Bastille)   Actually France was the dominate continental power until the Franco-Prussian war and remains a great power to this day.     I must respectfully disagree with this latest assertion, since France was smaller in size and less influential than both Austria and Russia before the Prussian war. Even if one were to concede that it was the main """"continental"""" power, that would imply a loss of status - before the Napoleonic Wars, it was the main European power, including Britain, and had beaten combined enemy armies time and time again. As for keeping great power status to this day, I'm sure that that should come as great surprise to the French, humiliated by Nazi occupation and resolutely defeated both in Vietnam and Algeria. Now, it's true they can veto stuff in the UN - just like the (then) underdeveloped island of Taiwan did until 1973, for whatever that's worth.  Aussiesta who cares about your stupid POV? you are telling nonsense. nazi humiliation etc, pff. weren't the US humiliated in vietnam, in cuba and now in iraq? so they aren't great anymore then right? didn't the soviet retreated from afghanistan? what about them? the german were defeated and occupied in 1918 and 1945 what about them? what about the old good british? they were wiped by the germans in the campaigns of 1939 (Norway) then 1940 (France) and Dunkirk, a defeat transformed into a great victory, what a joke! actually in indochina and algeria the french had 10 times less casualties than their opponents, is this a defeat? a defeat is supposed to happen when one is loosing a war not when he is winning it. these two decolonization wars were wasted by politics. the very same happened in the overlooked Suez Crisis of 1956. the british surrendered there. they left their french and israeli """"allies"""" without warning. ever heard about the Madagasacar war of independence? no? why? because france smashed the rebellion in a such violent way there are ashamed of. no one knows what happened in madagascar in 1946 so it is not in history books. moreover france is still a great power with remaining overseas territories and a strong nuclear force (the third one in terms of warheads after russia and usa) your beloved austrian and german doesn't have. so watch your tongue. quoting a non neutral POV is just the same as giving your own opinion. who do you think you can fool with your francophobic tricks?

He was somewhat of a land speculator, and he very nearly owned Prince George. He tried to buy the land right out from under the GTP's nose, as they were footdragging, as they often did. Anyway, the GTP and Millar quarreled for years over the townsite and bridges and their rival sternwheelers. But the histories are clear that it's the same man, a Toronto lawyer and all that.	0

78436	"""   Canadian Association for HIV Research   The Canadian Association for HIV Research (CAHR) is the professional organization of HIV/AIDS research in Canada or by Canadians.  CAHR includes all researchers and all disciplines of the scientific approaches to HIV and AIDS, for the purpose of its better prevention and treatment and ultimately for its eradication and cure.  Disciplines represented by CAHR include basic science, clinical science, epidemiology/public health and social science.  http://www.cahr-acrv.ca  CAHR reflects their vision, speaks on their behalf and advocates for their interests.  CAHR also works to promote excellence in research and collaboration among researchers.  An estimated 65,000 Canadians were living with HIV infection (including AIDS) in 2008.  http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/aids-sida/research/index-eng.php  Research in the area of HIV/AIDS is critical to combat the epidemic.   CAHR Mission Promote excellence in HIV research Foster collaboration and cooperation among HIV research communities, including basic science, clinical science, epidemiology & public health, and social science Promote education and the development of new researchers Provide a unified voice for Canadian HIV researchers and engage diverse stakeholders (community, industry, Government, NGO’s etc.) in ongoing dialogue and knowledge exchange to ensure that HIV research remains responsive to their needs. http://www.cahr-acrv.ca/about/vision-mission-history/   CAHR works with the Government of Canada to influence public policies that will ensure the optimal benefit to those living with HIV and the optimal return on the governments’ HIV/AIDS investment. CAHR also works with the pharmaceutical industry to ensure that the Canadian environment is ideal to attract industry support for ethically sound and high caliber HIV research.  The organization has a responsibility to people living with HIV and AIDS to ensure that high caliber research is conducted that is meaningful and relevant to their needs. In doing so, CAHR helps to ensure that high caliber studies in all areas of research are being conducted that benefit those living with HIV/AIDS and that help prevent the spread of HIV among those not currently infected.  The CAHR Council is comprised of two groups; the Executive Council and Council Members. The Executive Council is made up by the President, Past President, President-Elect, Treasurer and Executive Director. Council Members include the CAHR secretary and representatives from the community, social sciences, basic science, clinical and epidemiology & public health.  CAHR’s principal event is the annual Canadian Conference on HIV/AIDS. This conference is the venue where HIV researchers in Canada present the results of their work and engage in knowledge exchange activities with their peers as well as with investigators in other disciplines and with the HIV/AIDS community. The conference is held each spring and location varies each year. http://www.cahr-conference-acrv.ca/   References  External Links  CAHR on Facebook  CAHR on Twitter  Canadian Institutes of Health Research  :Category:Medical Research Institutes :Category:Health Canada :Category:Funding Bodies of Canada :Category:Research Institutes in Canada :Category:Medical and Health Organizations Based in Canada e"""	0

31962	"""  (deindent) Not even wrong only if you don't understand what he's doing. These are all standard problems for the many millions of people who have tried to make sense of infinite arithmetic at some point in their lives.  The number  ...9997 in Archimedes' system is also known as the number -3, which almost is the """"largest prime"""" in Ludwig's order on the Plutonian integers. You would think ...99998 might be the right one, but that's -2, and it is clearly divisible by two. So maybe ...9997 should be thought of as divisible by three, but dividing by three is different than dividing by two in base-10, because two divides 10 and three does not. So maybe that's a self-consistent definition in a 10-based infinite arithmetic with the order he chooses. Maybe not. I don't know, but neither do you, and to pretend otherwise is insincere. It's not incoherent, just original, and incomplete. The methodology is obviously many, many, painstaking infinite digit calculations, with the extra burden that the rules keep shifting whenever he finds an inconsistency.   The reason he claims transcendental numbers are incomplete is because, if you accept that the integers are Plutonian, the real numbers are only """"finitely"""" wide. Normally, a real number can be thought of as a map from Z->digits, giving it's digit sequence. Unfortunately, Plutonium's """"Z"""" is just as large as the real numbers, so that a real number is really only a sequence of digits, because a sequence in this view cannot be viewed as a map from Z-> digits. In this view Z is larger than any sequence (the integers are """"uncountable""""). So the real numbers have """"gaps"""" which would be filled by reciprocals of infinite integers. But large integers don't have reciprocals in Plutonium's system, because he can't make any sense out of bi-infinite sequences:  Numbers like ... 999123.3333..... are not allowed because you can't do multiplication digit by digit.  So he doesn't think of the real numbers as containing the integers, he has two classes of numbers the """"Adic integers"""" which are infinite to the left and finite to the right, and the """"real numbers"""" which are infinite to the right and finite to the left, and it is illegal to add an adic integer and a real number.  The reason Archimedes Plutonium keeps working on the Riemann Hypothesis is because he feels he can say something new about the distribution of primes because he has knowledge of some infinite ones. This is because he can ask questions like """"if I choose an infinite integer at random, digit by digit, do I get a prime number?"""" Those sorts of questions have analytic counterparts about real numbers (complete numbers really). He probably feels the twin-prime conjecture is false, becuase, what's the chance that the infinite integer ....321113 and ....321115 are both prime? He also probably feels that an infinite even number can never be the sum of two primes. These last two statements are both based on my own thinking. He might thinks that there are very many primes at infinity, I don't know for sure.  Look, I am not saying his mathematical musing are not cranckish. But recognize that Archimedes Plutonium is to cranck science as Isaac Newton is to mainstream science. He has seen futher than others even though he stands on the shoulders of no-one. """	0

13902	"""   I need an advocate and help with mediation   Greetings,  I need an advocate who will walk me through the mediation process.  I am trying to get the following added to the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.  Max Tegark is a renown physicist and a PhD profressor of cosmology at MIT.  He agrees with my addition.  I am having problem with an editor by the name of Lethe who follows me around Wikipedia reverting all my edits without commentary.  I have tried reasoning with him on discussion pages, but he refuses to read what I write.  Advantages of MWI  If Hugh Everett's theory was just another interpretation of Quantum Mechanics it would have no followers, especially since it proposes the existence of countless other universes which theoretically can never be observed. Because it is not falsifiable it seemingly violates Popper's criteria for a good scientific theory. The reason it has so many adherents is because it offers numerous advantages over the Copenhagen Interpretation, among which are the following:  1. Quantum mechanics becomes a deterministic theory making it more compatible with the theory of relativity and all other physics theory to date which are all deterministic. The Copenhagen Interpretation introduced indeterminacy and randomness into science. Aside from the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics there is no scientific theory that includes indeterminacy or randomness. Einstein particularly objected to this aspect of the Copenhagen Interpretation. In response to it, he said, """"God does not play dice with the universe.""""  2. It eliminates the """"measurement problem.""""  3. It eliminates Von Neumann's """"boundary problem"""": where to draw the line between the micro world where quantum mechanics applies, and the macro world where it does not. Shortly before his death in 1953, Albert Einstein wrote: """"Like the moon has a definite position whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects.""""  4. It eliminates the special place for an observer and human consciousness.  5. It restores objective reality of the universe between measurements. Shortly before his death, Albert Einstein also wrote: """"Observation cannot CREATE an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the possibility of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.""""  6. The wave-particle duality paradox evaporates. It simply and naturally explains the double-slit experiment. Richard Feynman said, """"[the double-slit experiment] has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality it contains the only mystery."""" David Deutcsh wrote: """". . . the argument for the many worlds was won with the double-slit experiment.""""  7. Schrodinger's Cat paradox evaporates.  It seems Einstein's main objections with quantum mechanics had more to do with the Copenhagen Interpretation, than with quantum mechanics itself. While MWI does not quite generate the kinds of worlds necessary to justify the anthropic principle, it is a step on the way to Stephen Hawking's No Boundary Proposal and Max Tegmark's All Universe Hypothesis which do justify the anthropic principle.

Alexander the Great, a Greek in his own words unfortunately for your little example on the Arb page, solved the knot the same way Chris0 did, without a care and with the sword.

So, I have to ignore my need to be well mannered and respond to you publicly.  I must say that I am rather disappointed that an editor with your expertise would be so rude to a newcomer - totally disregarding the Wikipedia rules of 'Do not Bite the newcomer'. No one likes spammers including me - but surely you should check out your facts before accusing people. And you should also give them the chance to read their first mail and figure out how to navigate this system before threatening them.  I was not trying to promote my site or increase my rankings. I was trying to share information learned from years of real life observation on a topic that is not well known on many species of birds that wikipedia has very scanty information about. (information I myself was desperately searching for before I commenced my research.) I apologise for my error. I have deleted the remaining links and will leave the hole in the wikipedia information untouched. (I did not notice all the other external links being discussed in the article talk pages. It would also be a huge time consuming exercise for the editors and myselfto do that for nearly 36 species and more on an on-going basis.)  It seems Wikipedia has still a long way to go in making genuine contributors welcome. I hope other users are treated with more politeness and consideration in the future.  Kind regards, Maghie (talk)  Maghie   It seems to me that your only contributions to date are to add external links to your website from various bird pages; see WP:EL which is about the adding external links.

Now from the perspective of a normal criminal process, this usually means the police had a weak case. The fact that the police were gung-ho about this case may also suggest that the police had no case at all (judging by the seemingly high-profile aspect to this case). In other words, Homeontherange's addition of that information is a pretty clear sign that the information is being added in order to disparage James Scott Richardson.  What is my point of reference? Well. When I added information to Alex Kulbashian and Richard Warman about a Canadian Human Rights Commission complaint file by Alex against Richard, Homeontherange removed the information stating that the complaint could have been filed, however it wasn't serious enough to because there was no evidence the Commissioner signed off on it. Now, getting back to this case, the crown attorney and/or withdrew the charges because there was no prospect for conviction.  To Homeontherange: If you are going to have double standards in """"enforcing"""" wikipedia's criteria for information posted in articles, then that shows your political motivation behind your edits and the way you handle your """"administrative"""" tasks.

53965	"""  Disputing """"Job Guarantee"""" Section Chartalists don't guarantee a job.  They merely argue that the role of government in cases of underutilization is to provide the necessary demand to resolve that situation, since otherwise you have unused capacity and net economic loss.  It's quite a jump to take that and conclude the government hires everyone who isn't employed; in fact, it often means the government becomes the customer of a lot of businesses.  If you are in a state of underutilization that represents an economic loss, and it's due to a demand problem, it means you must have some net fiscal expansion from some source in order to drive utilization.  If the private sector is attempting to build assets (run a surplus) and you have an external deficit, the only mathematical means of accomplishing this is public deficit, that is, the government is either hiring people or buying from the private sector.  So the section I've marked for expert review needs to recognize that Chartalists prescribe that government deals with unemployment not by guaranteeing a job, but by hiring more and/or spending i.e. buying more from the private sector.  Things could easily, and likely would, weigh more towards the second option.   (posting on behalf of one Filburt)"""	0

115716	Suggested clarifications   I think Gilles objection to using ports as classification is that it may be confused with the number of valves promoted by post petrol engine manufactures. I suggest usine 'Dual cycle' instead of 'four port' and 'Single cycle' instead of 'two port'.  The avec chariots ans sans chariots designs could be used in either layout. The AC would be better suited to an internal combution engine but would also suit say an gas pump or expander, due to the greater change in volume through the cycle.   The possible use as an internal combustion engine has recieved the most attention. It has many more uses - pneumatic motor, steam engine, refrigerant expander, pump etc. As far as I can see development is currently focused on the 'dual cycle', which is better suited to the majority of these uses, so perhaps the 'internal comustion engine' should be presented as a simply possible use of the single cycle configuration.  Photo-detonation/HCCI/SCCI/ATAC really warrant a seperate page with a mention here that the Quasiturbine is better suited to it than current engine designs due to the quick compression rate at 'tdc'  It is theoretically possible to use different fluids in the pump, as long as cross-contamination is not a problem. You could use hydrolic oil to pump air, as long as it doesn't matter if your compressed air is full of hydrolic oil! The fact the rotor is exposed to both 'cycles', there will be a layer or oil on the face plate when it is on the 'air' side. Seals and tolerances would also have to be right for the 'thinner' fluid, meaning an increase in friction compared to puming a thicker fluid. There isn't any evidence this has been tested, however.	0

65621	I know that is the current convention, but it is not a very helpful one.  Most of the people who live in the outlying boroughs of Greater London - the ones that were 'grabbed' when the GLC was set up, like Romford (Essex), Bromley (Kent), and Richmond (Surrey) - continue to use  the old country names, and will probably do so for another hundred years.  I live in the London Borough of Croydon, which has been a London borough for much longer than Barking or Romford, but many people still refer to it in their postal address as 'Croydon, Surrey'.  I think to avoid confusion articles like this should at least make it clear that the old names are still in common use.  Otherwise people will come here after Googling 'Barking Essex' and then wonder if they have got the right Barking.109.158.132.88	0

Regardless of the WP:TRUTH that you seem to think you hold, Wikipedia works on a) WP:CONSENSUS, b) reliable sources, and c) a collegial editing environment. Your edits clearly show you're harassing an editor that you disagree with. You will not be permitted to continue that way. Please also note: stop typing in ALL CAPS - it's considered to be shouting, and that doesn't go over well on the internet (talk→ BWilkins ←track)   Regardless of the WP:TRUTH that you seem to think you hold -  No, those rules are from WIKIPEDIA not me. What i dont see is you addressing the blatent biased opinion, synthesis, on an article which is viewed by others.  Please tell me does wikipedia allow ADMINS to hold a biased one sided opinion? When SIKH HISTORY admin have openly declared adherence to a strict orthodox viewpoint, you as MOD should really be enforcing wikipedias own rules on your own admin. You unblocking me is secondry to the blatent disregard for wikipedia rules on diet in sikhism. So its NOT MY truth that i hold, its wikikpedia rules that i hold, which YOU disregard. Now you have barred me, because you deem me argument on integrity an attack on ADMIN, when i have repeated over and over again, its an ISSUE of an article which is purely one sided. Now does wikipedia allow blatant disregard of rules from their own ADMIN?   From the same scholar, same book, same ISBN NUMBER, one rejected and one accepted, the accepted statement fits in with the ADMINS own orthodox stance which he has openly declared on his Wikipedia page.   1.QUOTE FROM ARTICLE - Gobind Singh Mansukhani states how vegetarianism and meat-eating has been left to the individual Sikh. 2.QUOTE FROM DELETED PASSAGE -scholars hold a view that Sikhism has an ambivalent view on diet, yet some accept that there are,   “passages against meat eating”. REF for both 1 and 2. Gobind Singh Mansukhani, Introduction to Sikhism, Delhi: Hemkunt Press, ISBN 81-7010-181-6, “There are passages against meat, in the Adi Granth”. Both references from the SAME scholar, yet one is accepted which is favor of an ambivalent view towards diet, while another assessment from the same scholar admitting their are passages against meat eating, is not accepted. Why the Double standards?   Why does the ADMIN on sikhhistory, blatantly support their own ideological stance, to the point of synthesis, and selectively using texts and passages, from authors who they cite, and then reject the same authors when going against their position?   How can you adressing harassment, yet make no attempt on addressing the issue of BIAS in your articles? Do you only protect the Orthodox Sunni islamic view? and the unorthodox shia view?...IF that is not the case, then please can you tell me why sikhhistory ADMIN have taken the biased stance of only abiding by an orthodox POV.  I dont think these questions im asking is harassment, but if my objection is avoided time and again, and the same allegations being made towards the same ADMIN for being one sided, you again have AVOIDED the issue at hand, which is a biased article protected by ADMIN to support their own beleifs, i think that is a greater offense than my trying to get some sense from the ADMIN in question. lol.	0

92807	"""   List of products in The Simpsons   Hello George. I see you've been actively making additions to List of products in The Simpsons. It is good that you're enthusiastic about the list. However, I would like to suggest that you might be going a bit overboard. There are literally thousands of products and stores in The Simpsons that are seeing in single shots as throwaway jokes, etc. If one were to list them all, the list would be fairly bulky and useless (this has happened on other Simpsons lists already and have had to be cut back). I'd like to suggest the following guidelines: Stores aren't products, so I would suggest you not list stores such as """"Herman's Military Antiques"""". Bulk groups of products like the """"many antiques at Herman's Military Antiques"""". Do not include real-world products like """"English Muffins"""". If you do that, it's pointless. Everything in the house is a product. TVs, couches, drapes, carpet, etc. Besides which, I would argue that noone in the world would ever need to look up whether English muffins are sold on the Simpsons. Real world products are assumed to exist on the show since it is rarely shown otherwise. The list should really be for Simpsons-invented brand-names or invented products.  The next issue is subjective, but I believe crucial to keeping the list from spiraling out of control: Products on the list should only be included if they are used more than once on the show. Throwaway jokes like Itchy & Scratchy Land Personalised License Plates are basically just describing a joke on the show. The list is really designed more for things like Laramie cigarettes, squishys and things that make up the Simpsons lore than a list of throwaway jokes. That doesn't mean some of your edits aren't perfect for the list; I believe you added """"Radioactive Man Comics"""", """"The Springfield Shopper"""" and """"Li'l Bastard Kits"""". These are great ones, but things like """"Disemboweller IV"""" needn't be included.  I am going to be deleting some of the ones that fall into the bullet point list above (real-world items and bulk groups) but I'm not going to immediately delete single-appearance items, but I suggest you join a discussion at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject The Simpsons#List of products in The Simpsons.

And those teeming masses exist for the sole purpose of lifing the few exceptional people onto their shoulders. You and me, we're exceptional.

126602	I know I'm not going to be able to convince you based on past experience, but what you've done will probably do more harm than good. Almost no one is familiar with the name Acer floridanum, and despite the fact that recent publications suggest that Acer floridanum might be preferable (the conclusion of that paper wasn't entirely confident as I recall), it's a bit premature to be moving it. Aside from the one publication in a relatively unimportant botanical journal, there isn't much supporting the name. It's not considered accepted by the vast majority of sources (including ITIS, which I think is our standard). Besides, the taxonomy of the species is simply too volatile to be moving it around. DNA work could reveal tomorrow that it's a variety of sugar maple. It's best to wait until a name is more or less universally accepted. I would wait until the publication of volume 13 of the Flora of North America, which will include the Sapindaceae.  | talk  |  contribs	0

13596	POV tag added Throughout this article there is an overreliance on the organisation's own claims together with a lack of neutral sources. Claims are stated as if they are automatically true rather than just being statements made by the organization. The lead is especially flawed in this aspect. The whole ordering of the article, with its subsection headings, is also suspect - it reads like an advertorial. Important information is missing. There is a complete absence of any detail about who finances the organization, a crucial absence given that this might reveal more of the organisation's aims. For the same reason financing info should be near the top of the article, not at its very bottom.	0
3923	""" 2010 (UTC) I don't think the definition from Webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written (1917) . The idea that professionals """"supply disinterested counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain"""" is a bit naive, particularly in the I think a more realistic and up to date defintion is required. For instance, in the light of Holocaust, in which many German professionals acted as instruments of a disfunctional state, which would tend to indicate that """"service for others"""" may not be have the intention, but was taken to a tragic extreme. Likewise the recent financial crisis would tend to indicate that profession of banker (if it is a profession) has shown to conducted wholly for business gain (i.e. higher profit, larger bonuses), whilst other professions have shown themselves to be very interested in business gain, often to the detriment to the business (e.g. accountants in the Enron scandal).

158151	My contribution   I feel that I have to add something. Please note that the temporary solution defines Kosovo as a territory of Serbia and Montenegro under UN administration. Note that it's not defined as a part of Serbia, but the Union rather. This is mostly because they anticipated the future most probable status of Kosovo, a state within the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.   However, you must realize that Serbia's (and the Union's) consitution defines Kosovo as an autonomous region, temporary under UN administration. The current borders of Serbia (and SCG) are internationally recognized and used everywhere (with Kosovo-Metohija). However, Kosovo is nowhere treated as an entity indistinct from Serbia (and most definatly not indistinct from the S-M), as no faction in the world sees it that way. I suggest that a possible compromise is that we should add that the Kosovar Albanian goverment refuses the Belgrade suzeiranity and considers it not a part of Serbia, and then the other side of the story (Serbia & the world), however, pointing it not an official part of Serbia and Montenegro is, francly, I apologize for the expression, but it is, really nonsensical. Hope that you will solve the case!	0

108304	"""Ten commandments, part 2== I'm getting tired of having to scroll through several pages to get to the bottom, so I'm starting a new section.    Let's take a step back.  This article is the """"Ten Commandments"""".  That is the verses in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 that are universally called the Ten Commandments; the ones that are debated about being placed in public school; the ones that are talked about as the fundamental of morality.  It is not about the list in Exodus 34.  The article is not about the use of the words """"עשרת הדברות"""" in the Bible; it is about a particular Bible list that is called The Ten Commandments.  This is an important point, except that I would go further.  This article is not about a particular Bible list.  This is article about a cultural artifact known as """"the Ten Commandments"""" that is strongly influenced by the Bible.  Sections of the Bible have been translated, moved around, edited, cropped, etc., and then declared """"The Ten Commandments"""".  I think that many people think of the 10C as something where you just open the Bible up and there they are.  That's just not the case.  The cultural concept of """"The Ten Commandments"""" is significantly extra-bibical.  Haven't you ever seen that Late Show bit where Letternman takes someone's words and edits them to say something different from what they actually said?  You can't just say """"well, I've quoted the Bible, so it's a legitimate representation of the Bible.""""  You feel that this statement is not sourced.  Yet I am sure you agree that the number """"Ten"""" in the title """"The TEN Commandments"""" comes from the Hebrew phrase """"aseret had'varim"""" even if you personally think that this was a mistake.   Actually, I remain unconvinced of this.  I have seen no convincing evidence that the Bible using the word """"ten"""" and people referring to the """"ten"""" commandments are causally connected.  I certainly am willing to accede that this may say more about my knowledge of Bible research rather than about the 10C.  I do not think there is a better way of telling the reader that the etymology of the title """"The Ten Commandments"""" for the list in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 is from the Hebrew """"aseret had'varim"""".   So there are two problems immediately apparent here.  First, you have no cite for the claim that this is the etymology.  Secondly, even if it were the etymology, that would be an issue completely separate from whether the Bible actually says that.  After all, the etymology of the term """"Uncle Tom"""" goes back to a book by Stowe, even though the Uncle Tom character is not in fact an """"Uncle Tom"""".  Any reasonable person reading the text as it now is would conclude that the Bible, in the Ex 20 and De 5 passages, uses the term """"עשרת הדברות"""".  I don't see why you insist on retaining this misrepresentation.  This is a notable issue because, as you mentioned, the Ten Commandments are widely represented as being fundamental to Western Civilization.  Besides the numerous other problems with that claim, the fact that much of the importance given to """"The"""" Ten Commandments is extrabiblical opposes that view.    =="""	0

In Scotland, it can only be committed by males upon females, which appears to mean by persons biologically male at birth upon persons born biologically female. It is, therefore, a crime of specific personal violence perpetrated on females. [...] The act of rape must consist of penetration of the victim's vagina by the accused's penis.

126281	Hi! Some time ago you added a logo to a page created by me - Commander One.   There was also a screenshot on the page, but it was deleted. Could you please upload and add it.  Here it is https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2191286/c1/4-c1-catalog-themes.jpg  Thank you!	0
100476	Well I suggest you read that file again and turn your thinking cap on this time. I do not need a lecture about the 'meaning' of George Wrights actions from you. George Wright has destroyed the organization along with a couple of editors here, and others at Techinc Washing. I also think that your use of the term 'Technocracy fundamentalist movement' is ignorant and demeaning. I posit that you being a 'self styled expert' that bit off the whole thing, and has instantly digested it is a little comical. You are dead wrong in your appraisal. If anything those people are the ones that are more in the genre you are suggesting. Building church`s in a Technate ? Special Interest groups in a Technate. Kolzene wrote and edited much of the Q&A;, and according to wiki that is self generated original conclusion stuff then that is a form of 'advertising' and blog 'driving' to original conclusions. To say what they are doing is a movement is sad. There are two people their that self publish stuff, and have sucked in the unwary who do not stay long.  Further more you imply that movement has made 'progress' over time and become more interesting and more representative of the current status of things. That is not true. Technocracy was thought out originally to a purpose by a handful of brilliant scientists. Your implication of fundamentalism is just plain 'stupid'. You say that you have not read the book for a while ? Well I suggest you read the last two chapters with a view to opening your mind a little, and with a view to thinking about the design.  http://technocracy-incorporated.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Technocracy%2520study%2520guide.pdf Technocracy%20study%20guide.pdf  There were 200 to 300,000 people for a while that thought this was not only the way to go but worked toward that end. Now there are 4 people on the NET site and Two people on the TechCa site that claim they and their 'belief system' , reward and punishment, 'contract', and church building, and referendum Democracy voting voting is 'smart' These people are ignorant. You sound ignorant now also. Technocracy is important. It deserves to be fairly brought out. As to your suggestion about what I can do, you suck, and so does the horse you road in on. Oh and I did not 'assault' anyone, I told the truth about George, and since when do you decide what is unacceptable ? You are an ignorant person, or perhaps a believer like them. You now lack credibility.  ( )	0

BC vs BCE has been a long debated subject here, without a final answer.  All we have now is a compromise  one that's been in place for years.  Wikipedia has a stated Manual of Style policy on this (WP:ERAS), basically saying either is allowed, but it must be consistent in an article.  It states pecifically """"Do not change the established era style in an article"""".   In this case, unfortunately, Saul is AD/BC, so should not have any CE/BCE dates (except in quotes, links, etc.).  Per the policy, it is possible, though rare, for an article to be changed.  If you a specific reason for Saul to be changed to CE/BCE throughout, you should bring it up in its talk page as described in the Manual of Style.  Until you have consensus for that, we have to follow the general policy.     All is good.  It's unfortunate you ran into a quirky compromise policy so soon after joining Wikipedia.  Given we have the whole English-speaking population as potential editors, things actually run pretty smoothly for the most part.  BTW, note there is a British vs. American English compromise in place as well; some articles are in British English, and some in American English, and that's also unlikely to ever change.  It's a fun big world we live in!       Vandalism   Blocking can only be done by an administrator (which I'm not), but you can report it at Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism.

98151	"""  To Derild4921 and Sadads: If your main dispute is the sourcing with the original article then why did you not contact me, as I could have provided the additional source material - you can see from my contributions I just author Tunnels books on here. As I said above all the content of the original article is completely accurate and can be verified. I have provided a number of source links to justify that. Should I need more, no problem just advise me. As far as I can see I did broadly meet the Notability standards. This may not be in the GA format that you are looking for, but as Wikipedia content relies on volunteers passionate about their article subject, I feel you should be more supportive. As I confirmed above it was me who asked for the reassessment, only at that stage, a few days ago, did you offer to 'help' improve my article. The new article you created in your Sandbox, then only remains there for 1 day before you either lose the content or publish it - hardly enough time for me to discuss my objections about your new proposal to remove my article. To replace my article when you have not even finished reading Tunnels is ridiculous - surely any author on Wikipedia should at least have read the novel first, not sure how that can meet your verifiable Notability standards! That aside I have already correctly embarrassing errors concerning incorrect publishing dates and versions, wrong character and place names like Stynx and Hightail (not a one off). Others that come to mind include: The official publication date for the US Tunnels was January 2008 - it might have been that copies were available on Amazon earlier than that date, but that often happens in the UK and US. Nearly all territories have gone on to publish Deeper, and only a handful haven't yet published Freefall (mainly due to their own financial difficulties, and not because the performance of the series hasn't merited it!) - you can check this on the publishers website http://www.doublecluck.com/rights. The authors changed the title with Barry Cunningham - this article makes it sound as though he did it off his own back! There are two versions of the audiobook in the UK (the Davenport one is abridged), and also the American and German unabridged versions. Chester isn't """"about to killed"""" under SETTING - he is sentenced to go into the Interior! The Plot emphasis is all wrong and does not give a true insight into the overall storyline. The Setting and Plot areas you have changed are so badly written - and I am well aware of my own average writing abilities, but in comparison this new version lacks significant maturity. References to the Highfield Mole are confusing. Barry is now Barry Cunningham OBE, and there's no question that he signed JK Rowling for her first two Harry Potter books whilst he was employed by Bloomsbury. I would like my article reinstated and with your expert help and support I would like to improve and expand my sources, and thus improve my own knowledge of Wikipedia article standards. My priority is not, however, achieving GA status at the expense of diminished quality or informative reading. I do have the support of the UK fansite team on this. The authors have often been kind enough to verify and supply content for my article. Following my notification about your changes, they have emailed me their confirmation that they would also like to see the original version restored. I await your response. Thanks (  )"""	0

So who's to say the calls weren't also chosen because it was an abbreviation of the state's name?  There's plenty of examples of a station using calls with multiple meanings (such as WBBM-TV out of Chicago).  But my main sticking point is that WISN has referenced the calls while advertising itself as """"WISconsiN TV"""" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JFirQUXfc8)  My theory is that the station chose to keep the calls after the newspaper folded because they referenced the state's name as well (the station had only been using the calls for a few years when the paper folded, so the """"name recognition"""" argument is moot).  But regardless of why they kept the calls, I think the fact that the station made a conscious decision to use them to brand itself as """"Wisconsin TV"""" deserves mention.  """	0

In 1997, Smash Hits debated whether or not to put the boyband Damage on the front cover of an issue of their publication. They felt that, as the band were black, this may mean that they would suffer a loss of sales for that issue. It was mistakenly thought that Smash Hits had never previously had a band with an all black line up on the cover when in fact the likes of Sade, Neneh Cherry and Five Star had featured on the front page.	0

48985	There is a difference between making personal attacks and correcting disinformation. The worst of which I can be accused is attempting to correct disinformation, sometimes a bit impatiently. (On the other hand, when editors of the CTMU article were falsely and maliciously accused of forging source material - that is, personally attacked, and repeatedly - nobody said a word, and no moderator lifted a finger. Clearly, something's not right there.) Regarding the Mega Society, I'm afraid you're on your own. I'm not interested in it or its Wikipedia article. If it is associated with Langan or the CTMU, that may well be a shame...but if the truth be told, probably more so for Langan and the CTMU than the Mega Society itself.

91545	"""  Yeah, it's pretty fascinating. I disagree that New Englanders moved into New York City and changed the accent to non-rhotic. Lots of people moved into New York City...Jews, Italians, and Irish being the biggest. I think New Englanders might be around # 178 on the list of groups moving to NYC, and the New Engand -ar is so different from the NYC -ar that we can forget the whole theory. Also the Northern Cities accent shift is food for a nice academic paper (that's what scholars do, right?) but incorrectly implies that northern cities like Syracuse or Albany did something or other to change the accent from the rural acreas, when the truth is that the rural accent around Syracuse is the same as that in the city. People move back and forth all the time. You have to have a big city like NYC or Boston to have enough isolation to create a new accent. There is no variation in accent anywhere from eastern NY to Syracuse, city, rural, or whatever, because people move around too much and there is no isolation.

62756	(Sub)Tropical Storm - May 27-28, 1988?   Check it out. I was trying to find an image for Tropical Depression One in 1988, when I came across this, which looks like a well-organized unclassified storm just off of North Carolina. On May 26 a cold front extended across the western Atlantic Ocean. The next day, a circulation developed to the southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, with much of its convection sheared to the northeast; at the time, it might have still been frontal. Tracking to the northeast, by early the next day the center became more involved with the convection, though only based on interpolation from IR. By the time of the first visible image, it was just off of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, possibly extratropical or subtropical, based on the (presumably) cold air being entrained. Convection deepened, and three hours later it looked tropical, which is where I found the image. Unfortunately, there's no more Atlantic visible images after that due to an error. Nilfanion found this visible satellite image, meaning it must not have been very deep. Here's another, and here's a small one. Verdict? Probably an extratropical cyclone and maybe a subtropical cyclone that had some aspirations to do something.  (talk)	0

The Republic of Central Lithuania was neither formed because of the revolution nor during it. I kindly ask you to explain the connection between the Russian revolution and Central Lithuania before you put back the category.

Pozdrav tebi i sve najbolje: Totally agree with you Direktor, and I am sure that your highly reasonable opinions and facts you are presenting on wikipedia are highly respected and accepted by the waste majority of its readers. Please, if you can, - do your regular check-ups of the articles concerning South Slavic languages and make sure they’re not presenting some misleading information. I would just add to this, that although ‘the political reason is the officially maintained distaste of the so-called """"pan-Yugoslav commonness”’, this distaste should be ‘expressed’ in a more civilized manner than creating some non-acceptable partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area, or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the Central South Slavic system (language) at the templates featured in the articles about South Slavic languages and dialects. And most importantly - that ridiculous ‘pan-Yugo’ distaste which openly sends a message of hatred and separatism, should not, by any mean be reflected in the language area, because it only shows how low and how uncivilized its ‘supporters’ can be, no matter what ‘not-supported-by anyone-in-scientific-world’ theories they may point out as their sources.  And, at the end, as an example of a civilized political distaste between nations, here’s the example of Americans and Canadians. Majority of Canadians feel in a different extent, a kind of aversion to Americans, especially since the start of the ‘George-Bush-era’ in USA. But still, nobody says that Canadians speak a ‘different language’ than Americans, and nobody tries to hide the common history facts and the strong cultural and economical ties that exist between these 2 countries.

22256	""" Hello Hi Harebag!  Welcome!  When I saw the article on the Pigeon Force Police  Department, I thought it was a joke.  It is real.  I also started a new article on Larry Buendorf.  He's a secret service agent that wrestled a presidential assassin to the ground.  Any suggestions for improvement, let me know.  As for your article, I suggest a little background.  Mention the city and state name.  Fix the link.  Good Luck on editing!    Additional suggestions for Pigeon Force PD: Who's the chief? Any major history? Big crime solved? Any controversy or major lawsuit against it? When was it established? Was the area patrolled by the county sheriff before then and then the city was established (if so when?).  These are just tips.  Otherwise, there is a risk that someone will petition for the article's deletion because there is a board for that (thus destroying your hard work).  That's the reason that I wrote quite a bit about my new article first rather than just start out with a few sentences and add to it slowly.  I do plan to add more to my article, though.  Archives1 2 3 4 5 6  1. Please sign your messages so people know who is writing them and can write back to you.  You do this by clicking on the 4 squiggly lines about 3 inches below the box where you type.  2. There are people who search for things to delete.  Don't ask me why.  3. To add references, type in the reference after your sentence.  For example, type """"Boston is the capital of Massachusetts."""" then after the period type a < then ref then > then http.so and so then < then / then ref then >.  I can't do it here otherwise the computer will make my example into a footnote and you then wouldn't be able to see it.  The at the bottom, type { then { then reflist then } then } so that the references will print up as a list.  Another way is just to pull up an article, push the """"edit this page"""" and see how the computer source is written and copy it for your article.   I don't know the answers to your questions.  Just wait and see.  I wouldn't do 20 articles at once until you get a feel of what's accepted and what's not.  I'm the wrong person to ask.  Don't worry, people will come around.

This is ridiculous. I'm here trying to create a better encyclopedia and this is the support I get? Hell of a turn off.   While there are about 1000 administrators on wikipedia, only 14 of them have checkuser permission and 99% of the cases here are answered by just two of them, so you may have to be patient.  No article is so important that the sky will fall if it is stuck in the """"wrong version"""" for a few more days.  You can try a request for comment on the article to get some outside opinions if the usual editors can't agree.   Sounds like this system is broken. Only 2 of the 14 people actually do the work?

By the way, just for future note by anyone watching, the reason that it takes a while to get a response is because we have to deal with things like this; if people were, you know, patient/pleasant/appreciative, then we might be a bit more inclined to run checks.

61485	"""HERE IS MY POINT:  TODAY'S NEW YORK DAILY NEWS, MAR 15, 08  TOM BROKAW A ROGUE ON WACHY-PEDIA  Sunday, March 15th 2009, 4:00 AM  Jacobs/Getty Debate moderator Tom Brokaw talks prior to the Town Hall Presidential Debate at Belmont University's Curb Event Center. Related News ARTICLES Celebrity side dish: John Malkovich brushes Bernie Madoff off of his shoulders Tom Hanks' films are helping us 'Buck' up through tough times He’s one of journalism’s most beloved and respected men, but someone appears to have it in for Tom Brokaw.  Look up the former NBC News anchor on Wikipedia and you’ll find a review of his Emmy-winning reports, his best-selling books, his 20 honorary degrees. Until recently, you also would have found this sentence:  “He had been married to Meredith Lynn Auld (a former Miss South Dakota and author) from 1962 until 2007, when an alleged affair between Brokaw and Diane Sawyer ended their marriage.” The Brokaws’ marriage is very much intact (a Google image search shows them arm in arm at events throughout 2008 and 2009). Likewise, ABC News’ Sawyer remains happily married to director Mike Nichols. A rep for Brokaw said he “burst out laughing” when he heard about the supposed affair. Contacted in the arctic reaches of Finland, Sawyer sent back word through her rep that, “as cute as Tom is, she laughed so hard she nearly fell off the icebreaker she’s traveling on.” The purported affair, anonymously added to Brokaw’s bio on Feb. 27, was deleted after five days. Wikipedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh tells us the post “would constitute a ‘vandal edit’” but doubted the vandal could be found. “It’s an open system,” says Walsh. “People may use it to exert their views. But the biographies of living people are most scrutinized by our volunteer editors. It’s incumbent on the Wikipedia Foundation to make sure they’re accurate.” Walsh surmised that “someone with some agenda” was behind the post. Or maybe there’s more than one person. Clicking on the discussion page of Brokaw’s bio reveals attempts to slip in digs about his accent and personality. Wiki watchdogs rejected the insults, though not the unflattering picture of the newsman, which reminded one reader of “Clint Eastwood saying, ‘Do you feel lucky, punk?’ ” The effort to smear Brokaw recalls the anonymous Wiki attack in 2005 on former assistant attorney general John Seigenthaler Sr., who, it was falsely claimed, masterminded the assassinations of both John and Bobby Kennedy. Brokaw isn’t the only newsman targeted by Wiki vandals. “Some of our correspondents have stalkers who constantly post falsehoods,” says a source at another network news department. “We’ve had Wikipedia block posts from repeat offenders.” But the unflappable Brokaw isn’t calling for any investigations. Through his rep he said, “This is beneath comment.”  Previous Page Next Page 123 ADS BY YAHOO! Make $5000 Per Month Read How I Earn over $5000/Month Putting Links into Google.

49855	"""   Distribution of Obscene Material to Minors   Dear Anthere-  I am very pleased with this service, and have used it a great deal.  Unfortunately, it occurred to me to check on some of the articles that my children might utilize, and was quite badly shocked.  From what I can tell, this site is not in compliance with the applicable regulations of the State of Florida (or my own state, Virginia) concerning the distribution of pornography to minors.  Obviously, that is a decision to be made by the appropriate legal authorities.  Given that I do not wish to be complicit in what is apparently an illegal activity, I am ending my contributions to this site.  It is my hope that this encyclopedia will be a resource for our children as well as ourselves.  I would very much like to continue to participate, and I certainly recognize the impossibility of immediately censoring any article which breaks a law anywhere.  At the same time, reviewing your policy pages it appears that a very few people are responsible for this behavior, and that no coherent policy is in force.  Additionally, given the size of the effort, it is difficult for me to appreciate that the word """"consensus"""", which appears quite often, is being used appropriately.  While I obviously worry for my children's welfare and upbringing, I am more concerned, at this juncture, in being involved in an activity with appears to be illegal (to whit, a class 3 felony in the state of Florida).  I understand your policies on censorship.  At the same time, most pornography web sites carry disclaimers regarding """"you must be 18 years or older to enter, click here to so state"""".  Given that there is no such disclaimer, and that the inclusion would harm the effectiveness of this site, I am at a loss for how you should proceed.  I have, on my user page, outlined the various agencies to whose attention I would like to bring this matter to, and offer you, as Chairman of the Wikifoundation, the opportunity to discuss this with me before I take these actions.  I am quite sure that the majority of members have no interest in participating in an activity which would appear to be other that what it is:  an encyclopedia.

I have tried to stay away from here since the ANI was closed, but as you continue making accusations and comments about me, I must say that I consider your comments to be personal attacks and I consider the post that Gnangarra linked to in particular to be defamatory and libelous and I feel that you should agree to refactor those comments, and the other personal attacks you made about editors on ANI, as I see has also been previously suggested by Shell as well. The """"do not edit the archive"""" notices in the ANI archives are designed to prevent people from continuing discussions in the archives, rather than to prevent people removing defamatory material. You claim that you've been """"slandered"""" (actually libeled). I believe everything I have said about you has been absolutely true, however, if I have inadvertently made a mistake and it was pointed out to me, I would redact it. Unfortunately, every time I have interacted with you you have made demonstrably false accusations, accusing me of doing things I had clearly and provably not done at all and so I am rather reluctant to believe that I have posted something factually untrue, but I am quite prepared to go back and re-examine my comments and refactor if I have made a mistake. When you wrote these offensive and defamatory comments about me, I had been deliberately trying to refrain from saying very much on the ANI due to your previous hostile reactions to me and had actually made very few comments, only responding to people who were confused or misunderstood and thus your accusations at that point in time were totally over the top and unfair and did not measure up to the evidence of my posts. Additionally, you are completely anonymous and not known by your real life identity, whereas I have spent most of my time on Wikipedia editing under my full name and am well known and you yourself have even commented about knowing my full name, so I find your comments and accusations defamatory to me in the real world. I feel you should agree to refactor your personal attacks against, not just myself, but others too, and I must therefore support previous requests for you to refactor these personal attacks and false accusations. Please also note that BLP applies to all pages on Wikipedia, not just to articles, Wikipedia:BLP#Non-article_space, and so if you persist in keeping your personal comments about me, a living, known and identifiable person, I must once again for the nth time insist that you provide verifiable proof supporting your allegations and accusations because you are in violation of BLP.

Sarah: In #request (first line of my reply) I already gave permission to Gnan/garra to do what is needed in that now-unmentionable (for me) matter to remove from it anything that might be (mis)construed as a """"personal attack"""" by anyone reading it WP:NPA in reply to #request; but I myself do not feel comfortable touching an archived discussion in a project page, which is filled with comments that could be (mis)construed as """"personal attacks"""" upon me as well (""""rant"""", """"screed"""", expletives, etc.).

Thanks,  Talk    Re: I've moved List of Samurai Shodown characters to a user sub-page.   That's all well and good, but I have one major objection: present tense is how we discuss legend and literature in the English language, even if they never did happen, and even if it is a retelling of the distant past (see , for example). Unless there is a WP guideline for fiction that I am seriously missing, the present tense is correct. -NOOO  Nonsense. If this is being done absolutely to-the-letter correct, it should be very clear when things are taking place (and I don't think it's going to be that hard, considering how little backstory most characters have). It would be something like: In SS5, character is looking for blah. In SS, character is motivated by meh. Prior to SS2, character is on trip to ___ and does not make appearance. In SS2, character etc. etc. Granted, I'm nowhere near done revising the entire damn article, but what can I do? I'm busy in real life.

This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a band, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for musical topics.   If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not.  Some editors argue that in the light of this guideline:  Typical Wikipedia readers do not find pictures of Muhammad offensive  Exclusion of such pictures would result in the article being less informative, relevant and accurate.  No suitable alternatives are available, as these pictures are historic  As the policy states, """"Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not."""". Therefore, the primary mission of Wikipedia and its editors is to improve articles so they are more informative. Being offensive is not Wikipedia's mission.  In addition, there are no issues of copyrights as the copyrights for all these pictures have expired so the images can be used freely where relevant.  WP:NOT#CENSORED This policy states:  Wikipedia may contain content that some readers consider objectionable or offensive.  Wikipedia cannot guarantee that articles or images are tasteful to all users or adhere to specific social or religious norms or requirements.  Printing Images of Muhammad: A minority tradition?

133269	Well, I think we agree to disagree; this article is not easy to follow given the volume of text.  I'm aware of only one discussion prior to ours; where are the others?  As well, objections were noted previously: the article has grown significantly in size and is now unwieldy almost to the point of lacking utility.  I am also not proposing headings for all ranks: only the flag and officer ranks (which are lengthy sections on their own).  Lastly, any user can collapse the TOC on their screen.  As for the wikifying of real-world terms: the article does not at all link to the articles/concepts of rank and insignia that are described in the title and only weakly described after that.  That is bad form and should be upfront, not at the end.  I acknowledge and appreciate your contributions to the article, but resistance to changing it and your reversion can be perceived as exerting ownership over it.  To that end, I think it prudent to initiate a new discussion or RfC regarding these issues to enhance the article, and we should be guided by the results of that.  Thanks!	0

151129	Samantha Harrison   Hi. I've reverted some of your edits on the article Samantha Harrison again, because I simply can't find any references for them.  You're new here, so I'll explain simply: for every article, especially for articles about living people, you need to provide a source for a stated fact. Put it another way - if Samantha Harrison came along to her own Wikipedia article and found something on it not to be true about her, we could get into a lot of trouble (see libel). If we have referenced that fact from another reliable source (say, a newspaper article or a website), then we are not to blame for any untrue information because it verified from another source (even if the source is untrue about the fact).  Samantha being a member of the Southern Districts Hockey Club is a fact, and even though it was not referenced by you, a quick Google search by me took me to a New Zealand Herald article stating her to be so, so I added that article as a reference to the fact. However, other facts added do not return anything useful for a reference, so we can't state them - I can't find anything about going to Cambridge, or her parents' divorce (which the latter is also irrelavent information).  If you can find a source, feel free to re-add the information with the source. Wikipedia:Citing sources has information on the basics of doing so.  Thanks  (mailbox)	0

Now that User:Zlykinskyja has been hounded away from editing """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""", the wholesale axing of fully-sourced text has begun. See: removal of forensics. The apparent WP:Wikihounding of Zlykinskyja might have been as a woman, with legal expertise, trying to keep the article neutral in legal terms. I warned beware of """"colleagues gasping if they knew about editing on that lowly pedia"""". Perhaps if American student Amanda had been """"Adam Knox"""" then fewer people would want to remove sourced text disputing the evidence and 20? misquoted infamous statements. (I didn't know any evidence in December 2009, now I know much, and some seems falsified in Italy). Zlykinskyja tried to add how """"Donald Trump"""" rejected the verdict (+source), but that was quickly deleted. Some US officials are conducting a mock-trial by judge to compare verdicts, but I doubt that could be explained in the article. Then some prankster this week posted at top, """"Breaking news: Knox dead in prison from suicide, details not confirmed"""" (from an IP edit in the London area), and some say Knox cried in jail when she heard WP posted that. I wish we could split the article into several low-target subarticles (I noted Manson Family has 17 spinoff articles). The talk-page has resisted any attempt to reduce the rabid focus on """"Amanda Knox"""" and naturally, a prior subarticle was AfD deleted.However, I suggest the following:  """"Amanda Knox"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article with civil suits, appellate trial, and college coursework in prison.  """"Raffaele Sollecito"""" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article, noting he completed his computer degree while in custody, and they met, at a classical music concert, because he looked like Harry Potter.  """"Prosecution of Amanda Knox"""" (new) - would contain all the pro/anti-Knox text, moved from edit-wars in the Kercher article.  """"Investigations of Kercher murder"""" (new) - would be a forensic article, with fingerprints, Low copy number DNA, luminol, unidentified DNA/prints, listing exact quotes+sources, etc.  """"Murder of Meredith Kercher"""" (reduced) - would be trimmed into an overview, linking sections to subarticles. I have seen how other articles, split into subarticles, greatly reduce the vandalism in the spinoff details, so that forensic details would likely match the sources, when viewed there. This message is just a general notice, sent to a few admins, and I don't expect an immediate response. Also, feel free to delete this, knowing it was posted in a 1 May talk-page revision: as a May Day warning about axing of Kercher text. Thanks. -  """	0

Everyone who has ever visited places both in the continental climate and near the ocean must know that places near the oceans have much more stable temperatures (while the continental climate has much more brutal variations) because the relevant layer of water has much higher heat capacity than the relevant layer of soil. The water is circulating and can actually swallow or release the heat from up to hundreds of meters of the upper ocean pretty quickly; on the other hand, it takes years for the heat to get dozens of meters of the soil.  That's also why the continental ice sheets are much more variable - and much more important for the global variability of the climate - than effects that occur on the sea. They may appear or disappear mostly on the Northern Hemisphere. At any rate, the Milankovitch theory works, as settled in Roe's paper.

The word Progressive has everything to do with House music that was played at events such as Renaissance.  Your reference to the gap being filled by MBO & Capricorn, then the beginning of Techno, is false. Chicago House was the big scene in the midwest and this is the influence (and the gap) that the Detroit guys were using to design their version of House music. Larry Heard had everything to do with what Detroit was up to. Experimental type Techno obviously deserves a place in the history, but as far as dance records, It was modelled hugely after what Ron Hardy was playing in the Music Box. The output of labels such as Trax, DJ International, and Jack Trax was monstrous in comparison to the small industrial wasteland scene of Detroit at the time, along with it the labels that were releasing """"Techno"""" - Metroplex, KMS etc. This large volume of output in Chicago is what was filling the gap.

It has been suggested that the current name is an amicable compromise as per WP:NPOV, however this is not a proper implementation of that policy. WP:NPOV is not a trump-card for WP:COMMONNAME for use by those people who for one reason or another disagree with the wording of the most common name. Wikipedia in fact has a policy specifically for pages such as this, WP:POVTITLE, which has not been followed in this case (text included below). Lastly, to keep the current name is to give undue weight (WP:UNDUE) to the people who disagree with the term Female genital mutilation, we must remember that Wikipedia is about what is verifiable and sourced and not what one or more member's opinion on an issue is. There is no debate in the relevant literature over whether female circumcision is in fact mutilation, and Wikipedia should reflect the consensus achieved in verifiable and authoritative sources.   WP:POVTITLE: """"When a significant majority of English-language reliable sources all refer to the topic or subject of an article by a given name, Wikipedia should follow the sources and use that name as our article title (subject to the other naming criteria). Sometimes that common name will include non-neutral words that Wikipedia normally avoids (Examples include Boston Massacre, Rape of Belgium, and Teapot Dome scandal). In such cases, the commonality of the name overrides our desire to avoid passing judgment (see below). This is acceptable because the non-neutrality and judgment is that of the sources, and not that of Wikipedia editors. True neutrality means we do not impose our opinions over that of the sources, even when our opinion is that the name used by the sources is judgmental.""""   """	0

83435	Research shows that one of the most prominent characteristics of infant directed speech is the wider opening of the mouth that is present in those using infant directed speech versus adult directed speech.  This differences occurs especially in vowels.  Vocal pitch is also heightened during infant directed speech and research indicates vowels are spoken with the highest pitch when infant directed speech is used.  The horizontal positioning of the lips in infant directed speech does not differ significantly from positioning used in adult directed speech.  Instead, the only observed difference remains in vertical lip positioning.  By making the opening of the lips larger, infants are more likely to focus on the face of the speaker.  Research suggests that the larger the opening of the lips during infant directed speech, the better infants will understand the message being conveyed due to the additional visual cues available.  The intensity of speech, however, does not differ from that used in adult directed speech contrary to popular belief.     Infant directed speech does not only include the characteristics of high pitched speech and elongated syllables, but also incorporates visual body movements that assist in conveying meaning of language to infants.  One monumental visual aspect of infant directed speech is the movement of the lips.  In addition, head movements are used to emphasize various syllables within language production.  These visual cues provide infants the additional information needed to perform accurate speech discrimination during language development.  Further, visual cues allow infants to discriminate speech differences in environments in which they cannot rely on their hearing, such as in noisy environments.  The auditory and visual aspects of infant directed speech do not exist independently, however.  Infants rely equally on both methods of understanding and as development continues, infants strengthen the link between these two important categories.    It must be considered that although infant directed speech features marked characteristics, it may not only be these characteristics aiding in development of language for children.  Due to the visual cues used  by caregivers in this method of communication, infants are more highly motivated to engage in communication.  Because infants are willing to participate in this process, caregivers are able to make significant progress through the use of infant directed speech.    It is often assumed that infants are interested in the properties of infant directed speech and play a passive role in this interaction.  However, research indicates that infants are not only attracted to the practice itself but to people who engage in infant directed speech.  Through this practice, infants are able to determine who positive and encouraging caregivers will be in their development.  When infants use infant directed speech as a determinant of acceptable caregivers their cognitive development seems to thrive because they are being encouraged by adults who are invested in the development of the given infants.	0

87670	"""  Wikinews Australia Day   I notice you haven't been at Wikinews for a couple of weeks.  However there is an article stuck at the starting blocks for a couple of days that might benefit from another Australian taking a look, so I hope you don't mind my posting here at Wikipedia:   Australia celebrates Australia Day 2009  (It reports on the cricket in Adelaide, if that interests you.)      It is now published.  Good luck for the ODI in Perth!    Yeah, I pinged someone on IRC to review it, because I wasn't sure of the current standards. Regards,      Archived clarification    Perhaps I am missing something and you have been requested to archive this; however, as we are still in the middle of voting on motions here, could you please reinstate this?  Thanks.     Once a motion reaches the majority (or in this case, the majority plus a couple), and has been that way for 24 hours, it is considered passed. Is there any special circumstance which allows you to request the passing of this motion to be delayed?    The motions passed at 01:51 on today's date, which is less than 24 hours. As well, additional clarifications were made in the last 24 hours. I wouldn't call them """"special"""" circumstances, I expect them to remain on the page for at least the 24 hours after the motion passes so that the involved parties can read them.     Oh, so you'd like me to restore them for three hours then, despite the fact that they are going to read them when I deliver the talk page notifications anyways? Go right ahead. Done. Please also note that in future, given this little piece of silliness by the Committee, everything is going to be archived right on time, and if any member of the Committee objects they need to show me a majority of the Committee supporting their viewpoint before they can do anything about it. It's this kind of ridiculousness—I'm going out in two hours and hence, given the votes over and beyond the majority, it has never been a problem to archive something 3 hours early with such strong support for the motions—that pisses me off about the Committee. We follow the Arbitration Committee procedures, and hence your observation that we need to be """"requested to archive this"""" in your initial comment is a patently incorrect line of thinking. Ridiculous...    To be more precise, the first motion passed with Newyorkbrad's abstention at 02:22 UTC, and there were two clarifying comments made to that motion following his vote, in part to address his concerns. You're certainly encouraged to have a life outside of Wikipedia; it's one of the reasons why we have a group of clerks instead of just one. If it's not convenient for you to take an action, I am sure that another member of the team will be happy to do so.      Hi Daniel, sorry to toss another piece of bureaucracy at you, but since technically this was a clarification of the Martinphi-ScienceApologist case, shouldn't it be posted on that case's talkpage? onka  No, because it served to amend the SlimVirgin case. I will post a link at the talk page of the Martinphi-ScienceApologist case to where the motions are archived, but given the Martinphi-SA case wasn't the one being clarified or altered, it's correct residence is the SlimVirgin talk page.     Okay, thanks.  )  I wanted to link to the archive, so I wanted to doublecheck that I was linking to the permanent home.  Carry on, onka  No probs.

84320	"""==MTA== Technically, the MBTA replaced the MTA; it is legally not a descendant, but a new agency to which all of the assets of the old agency were transferred.  The MTA was financed under the authority of the Boston Metropolitan District (no relation to the Metropolitan District Commission), which persisted until all its bonds were retired in the late 1980s or early 1990s (check US Census Bureau's census of governments for details), long after the MBTA took over from the MTA.  (Many parts of what we now think of as the MBTA system were actually started under MTA jurisdiction.)  A good external reference is Scott Moore's NETransit site.   Shorter disambuator?  How about we move all the station and line pages from [[Name (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority)]] to [[Name (MBTA)]], so the title line isn't dominated by the disambiguator?  2051, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)  Having typed the long form seemingly ten zillion times in nearly as many articles, this sounds like a good idea to me!

The Red Line MAY have a connection to the Commuter Rail at the Cabot Yard or at a track near Neponset (just north of the Neponset River), but I doubt it. The Blue Line has no connections to any other rail lines. I think the Orange Line has a connection at Wellington, and the Green Line has only Riverside. So there MAY very indirect connections between the Red, Orange and Green, but they are never used except in emergencies (like when the Green Line flooded and Commuter Rail trains served Riverside).     Just checked a few sources. A June 2000 track map shows no connection at Wellington or anywhere else on the Orange Line. Same for the Red Line. Of course it also shows no Green Line connection at Riverside, and I know that exists (but is usually fenced off). The track I remember at Neponset is a dead end (Java). At Cabot Yard (Red Line) and South Bay Yard (Commuter Rail) the two systems are totally separated, lookign at aerials on that same site. So the only one remaining to check is Wellington.     Now the Orange Line USED to connect via Everett Shops, as did the Green Line (via surface tracks under the El). And the Blue and Red connected over the Longfellow Bridge, and there may have been a connection at Eliot Street Yard in Harvard connecting the Red Line to the streetcar line to Watertown and thus the Green Line, but I'm not sure about that. But at one point the Longfellow Bridge track did connect to other streetcar tracks. And I think I found a connection north of Wellington on aerials at http://www.globexplorer.com/ , but I'm not sure - shouldn't be too hard to spot from the Commuter Rail (harder from the Orange Line because of the unused east track) if it exists. But even if there is an Orange-Green connection via Commuter Rail (and fairly direct at that, using the Grand Junction Line), I would very much doubt it gets any use.     So how do you figure all those nice new Red Line cars were delivered from Barre, Vermont?     Ah, here we go. Blue has none. Red has one at JFK/UMass, Orange has one at Wellington (last used ca. 1981), and Green has one at Riverside. None appear to be used at the present time. It would be rather misleading to suggest that there are in fact connections. How's this? """"Except between the Red Line and Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line, there are no track c"	0

(the overabundance of quotation marks is one symptom, but there are other, such as the """"for the benefit of Europeans"""", which takes away from the neutral tone an encyclopedic article.) I'm not an expert on the subject (in fact I know very little about it, which is why I came here), but even to me it would be better if the page instead sourced a number of published treatises/works on the subject instead of going into a quasi-emotional and ambiguous personal essay-style on the subject. It sounds to me like the article attempts to unite the various concepts and make it as culturally vague and generalized and """"acceptable"""" (as in, lacking cultural, ritual and mythical specifics that would make different versions more characterized) as possible - and this makes the article sounds a little - dare I say - """"New Agey"""".

81601	, 10 December 2006 (UTC)  Queen Nefertiti of Egypt was a native of Mitanni. The Mittani Kingdom of Armenia was an off-shoot of the Hurrian kingdom. The Hurri and the Mittani in turn were the contemporaries the Hittites and the Hykos, within whom they shared many cultural and political aspects. Today, all these aforementioned nations are considered to be, in varying degrees, proto-Armenians, that is, we modern day Armenians are direct descendants of the remnants of those ancient tribes.  20:28	0

132964	"""   edits in Jan., 2012   Thank you for recently updating this article. I hope you continue. This article has had many adverse edits in the past and I try to keep it within Wikipedia's standards.  If a statement with two facts is supported by a source and one fact and the source are updated, check whether the source is positioned in the sentence to make it look like the source also supports the other fact. Then be sure the source does support both facts. Otherwise, readers will be misled. If that source does not actually support the second fact, you should find a source for the second fact or preserve the original source and place or edit it so that readers will know which fact is supported by which source. If a fact does not have a source cited for it, the fact can be challenged, edited, or deleted by any editor (the exception being, as Wikipedians sometimes say, that no source is needed for the fact that """"the sky is blue"""", or for any fact not likely to be challenged). Much about HSA has been challenged in the past (possibly because of political dislike toward Dr. Moskowitz) and sourcing should be carefully done.  Sources should be secondary, meaning at least one level removed from personal experience. Usually, that means an independent third-party reliable source. By contrast, for example, SA's website is a primary source about SA. Self-statements are primary sources. Primary sources are allowed but must be used with greater care and generally should be shunned (except in the External Links section, for example). Try to find secondary sources wherever possible. Part of Wikipedia's standard is at WP:PSTS.  The lede (sometimes spelled """"lead"""") should be a summary of the body of the article, so it doesn't get a reference. Because the lede is a summary, any statement in the lede should essentially be in the body, too, so the reference should be positioned where the body's statement is.  A tendency to write an article like an advertisement sometimes crops up. The recent edits to this article were mild in that regard; I've seen a much more obvious case recently in another article. While this school network has remarkable achievements that should be described, legitimately sourced criticisms also have to be included or preserved. Articles that are too much like ads are subject to severe rewritings or reversions to earlier revisions, often by editors less familiar with the subject.  Ref elements generally follow punctuation. For example, we'd write, """"This is a fact,Source A. and this is another fact.Source B.""""  Images need alt texts, so that people who are blind or visually impaired can have their browsers read aloud information about a picture. The old image also lacked an alt text for a long time and now I've added one (I could have long ago but didn't get to it). If you create a new image and add it, please add an alt text with it.

""""But of course the most sensitive """"nationality"""" [ethnicity] of all was Lenin's. In 1924, Lenin's sister Anna discovered that their maternal grandfather, Aleksandr Dmitrievich Blank, had been born Srul (Israel), the son of Moshko Itskovich Blank, in the shtetl Starokonstantinov [Old Konstantinov] in Volynia [Volhynia, now Ukraine]. When Kamenev found out, he said, """"I've always thought so,"""" to which Bukharin allegedly replied: """"Who cares what you think? The question is, what are we going to do?""""

In 1932 and again in 1934, Anna Ilinichna [Lenin's sister] begged Stalin to reconsider, claiming that her discovery was, on the one hand, an important scientific confirmation of the """"exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe"""" and """"the extraordinarily beneficial influence of its blood on the offspring of mixed marriages""""; and, on the other, a potent weapon against anti-Semitism """"owing to the prestige and love that [Vladimir] Ilich [Lenin] enjoys among the masses."""" Lenin's own Jewishness, she argued, was the best proof of the accuracy of his view that the Jewish nation possessed a peculiar """"'tenacity' in struggle"""" and a highly revolutionary disposition. """"Generally speaking,"""" she concluded, """"I do not understand what reasons we, as Communists, may have for concealing this fact. Logically, this does not follow from the recognition of the full equality of all nationalities."""" Stalin's response was an order to """"keep absolutely quiet."""" Anna Ilinichna did.

When his sister, Anna, found out, she wrote to Stalin that she was not surprised, and """"this fact"""" was """"another proof of the exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe,"""" and that Lenin had always contrasted """"what he called its 'tenacity' in struggle with the more sluggish and lackadaisical Russian character.""""

You are simply reacting defensively and irrationally. You may have invested a lot into it already, and that may be distorting your perspective.

I wish I had more time to take part in the discussions these days, but best guess is that 'current version' =! 'his version', therefore 'current version' =! neutral.

This is a statement that summarizes a broad concept that is common to most of the theories. Wikipedia's style guidelines say we are supposed to summarize the article in broad scope in the intro... that is what we do (even a quick look at the list shows that most of the theories claim this in some way.

27006	"""  Chile  Cielo Estrellado please please do not support Al Andalus on this. The word Mestizo is never used in the hispanic world to describe people who are predominantly European as is the case for most Chileans.   Firstly, as you may know, in Latin America it is used for those who are predominantly amerindian in their ancestry. (It would apply in Mexico and Central America).  Secondly, there is no defined ethnic group in Chile which can be defined as mestizo, there are just people with more or less Indian bood, Spanish origin being nearly always the larger part of the ancestry. There is no sense of common belonging shared exclusively by people with amerindian ancestry which excludes people who dont have this ancestry. This is a vital characteristic of an ethnic group. The word mestizo is pejorative in our language and should be used as little as possible. Ill give you an example. When the movie """"Harry Potter and the half-blood prince"""" came out in the Spanish speaking world, it was translated into Harry Potter and the Prince, because of the negative connotations that the word mestizo implied. Finally, in our cultural community, Latinness, Spanishness (or if you want to use racial terms """"whiteness"""") is an expansive concept which does not exclude people placind then in a different ethnic group on the basis of their blood being """"tainted"""" as happens in the Anglo Saxon world. Although, I agree that that in certain countries where racial divisions have been stronger due to a much larger Amerindian community, (such as Peru or Guatemala) leading to implications regarding identity and ethnicity..

I haven't seen you blocking Grandmaster when he accused Azizbekov of being a sock, claiming it’s so obvious in spite of the fact that he has provided no such evidences at all. Azizbekov was consequently banned when Vartan discovered that he was a genuine user. Neither have I seen you block him when Antranikpasha was claimed to be a sock, again without any evidences provided. As a consequence, Andranik was ALSO banned. I have better things to do than wasting all my time at a time like Christmas and the days following to document further something which is so obvious. I also find it weird that all your interventions have always been to support one side against the other as can be confirmed by your edit history.  Accusations without convincing evidences are what should be condemned, like those of Grandmaster’s every time a genuine user appears. Accusations should exist when we are facing with an obvious sock, which is the case with Ehud. And I will not be waiting weeks until you read anything at all, this condition is unacceptable. And I will not be contesting my block either. I know it will be plainly rejected or the request being ignored until the block is waved. I don't expect anything anymore. Its plain fishy, Vartan gets the restriction, I get blocked the next day for ridiculous incidences which is absolutely nothing in comparison with what has happened with Atabek.  It should be obvious that a block is too harsh of a punishment for accusation of sock-puppetry, especially when there is an ample amount of evidence of such sockpuppetry. Furthermore, a block should be preceded by an official warning on the user's page, with the clear notice that the user will be blocked next time. A simple request on other pages doesn't satisfy this.

I can see where the Myanmar side would be unhappy. However why should the Burma side agree to abide by the next decision? You can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with Myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with Burma. Husond is right, where does this end? When I first looked at this mess I said, and posted, that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will NOT be able to reach a FAIR compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it. There are good points for each argument. I'm in the Burma camp but that is how I see things. So I'm looking at 1) leave it where it is now, 2) split it into 2 identical articles, 3) some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily, 4) a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination.

17096	""" While I take your recommendation to heart, I have to insist that, by any plain reading of WP:NFCC#1, the image is keepable.  Let's look at the test in NFCC #1 & evaluate this image: Non-free content is used only where no free equivalent is available or could be created that would serve the same encyclopedic purpose. No free equivalent could be created to show what Berry looked like as a webcam pornographer at 16 or so no matter how we approach him as a 22-year-old anti-child pornography speaker & educator.   If non-free content can be transformed into free material, this is done instead of using a fair-use defense. The only way I could see to accomplish that with this photograph would be to ask Berry to permit its release under GFDL.  Permission would be impossible to obtain and it would be (to my mind) cruel even to ask Berry about it. Non-free content is always replaced with a freer alternative if one of acceptable quality is available. """"Acceptable quality"""" means a quality sufficient to serve the encyclopedic purpose. There is no freer equivalent available  Berry will never be a teenager again, and, since his appearance as a teenager is one of the issues raised by his critics, letting the reader draw their own conclusion seems more prudent & more neutral than telling them one way or the other what to think. As a quick test, ask yourself: """"Can this image be replaced by a different one, while still having the same effect?"""" If the answer is yes, then the image probably does not meet this criterion. As the effect is inextricably tied to the age of the subject as depicted on the websites he administered, there is nothing that would have the same effect as depicting him as others saw him at the time.  It is intrinsically true that Berry portrayed himself a particular way when operating his websites.  The only neutrality we can have on the subject is to show the """"facts""""  Berry's image then  and let the reader draw their own conclusion.   What say you?    No free equivalent. Non-free content is used only where no free equivalent is available or could be created that would serve the same encyclopedic purpose. If non-free content can be transformed into free material, this is done instead of using a fair-use defense.

Many comments have been made about procedural failures.

A decision to block me was made, which I will not contest, based on comprehensive notes from two editors and accusations that I provide no evidence. I did not know how or when to do so, but I am learning quickly.

I then posted a bold sourced here, which I encourage you to examine. You may see that they are in some cases minor clarifications, in others short simple neutrally toned presentations of divergent academic perspectives. In each instance the sources provided, apply only to the conceptual background of the claims made, and do not pertain to the specific line by line claims of this article, because, the citations largely concern the framework of the discussion not its extensive particulars.

If you prefer you can check it in other encyclopaedia like “Britannica” or some other – neutral of course ) Good lack with studies.  The Piast Dynasty  Mieszko converted the Poles to Christianity in order to compete better with the crusading and marauding Germans. During the reign (992-1025) of his son, Boleslaw I, the Christian church was firmly established in Poland. Boleslaw also conducted successful wars against Holy Roman Emperor Henry II and considerably expanded the Polish domain. He was crowned king by the pope in 1025. At his death, Poland extended beyond the Karpaty Mountains (Carpathian Mountains) and the Odra and Dniester rivers.	0
36255	Insulting to Geographic Information Science ive not seen one person argue with your view statistically speaking, however you have basically besieged an entire field of research with your views. Nvj, are you a statistician, neither am i; noone is accusing you of being wrong... get it. learn how to write an academic article perhaps. I highly dislike your edits of spatial dependence for example, you draw the discussion of a valid field of statistics, geography, topology, and topography, and turn it into an argument against kriging. Im sure that there is a conspiracy group somewhere that you may participate in, eg. 'I think it is all because of the freemasons'. however geography is a serious science, the applications of which im certain that you have not truly studied, or understood. currently I work for the government in the analysis and creation of geographic information, while i can appreciate your argument on kriging, i do not believe that it belongs in the majority of articles concerning GIScience related topics, as that is what geostatistics is. Personally, I do not use kriging in the limited analysis that i do perform, I prefer the triangulated irregular network or the distance weighted average.	0

It says """"describe the opposing viewpoints"""". And where does this article do that ??? Rather than describe describe the opposing viewpoints, it suppresses opposing viewpoints.  This is why the article is biased, censorsed and therefore must be deleted.

53939	I completely agree that the dependence on Kinsey (who himself cites a vast array of other sources including some of the ones I previously mentioned) is a weakness in the article. The Wikipedia entry then appears to be summarising his book rather than using it as a partial reference. Kinsey has a new book coming out on the Elstree years which will no doubt be useful in this department, alongside the other books. However, I would have thought that the purpose of a further reading list is to provide other sources of information on a subject that the reader of the Wikipedia article can consult to find out more about Hammer in this instance. The Bibliography on this page does not include all the book sources cited in the references either. I'd suggest adding these at the very least. The books I'm thinking of cover far more than this article has scope to, and thus I believe should be included.	0
79972	Appreciated, but it is replies like what you just gave that prompted such a response (calling you a 'little hitler'). I'm sorry if this was misinterpreted as a sort of ad hominem slur, but I meant it is such and I stand by my humble opinion. I asked before but was not answered so I will ask again: why can other people have a page about themselves but not me ? Putting a message over my page is a bit of an insult. I would have preferred for you to delete it immediately without warning and then tell me what I did wrong so that I could make the page better, but you chose to sh** on it instead. All or nothing, you chose 'a little bit'. Again, you are a little hitler, and a coward. I 'may have to' report you. Threats from a little man dressed in brief authority, as though such threats ('may have to', 'last warning', 'final warning'). Truth be told, I was going to just delete my page (and my account) but when I logged in, someone else had done it for me... I posted a simple page and within MINUTES it was flagged... you obviously don't know who I am and you obviously think that this is acceptable. You also have the authority to be a basterd towards me over the internet, but you would probably not do that in the real world eh ? I run a business, I make something of myself and I spend 2 minutes writing a wikipedia article about myself... and then someone who spends 10 hours a day on wikipedia comes along and puts his foot down.  Well, little hitler, have a nice day. I won't bother anymore with this ridiculous website. I checked the HTML source code of my page anyway and WikiPedia puts a rel='nofollow' on all anchor tags, so it's all pointless.	0

Talk pages are also not strictly a forum to argue different points of view about controversial issues.

50301	It appears that Cailil is the only person taking issue with a comments and criticisms section. It is pretty much default procedure for editors to place a comments and criticisms section in articles, particularly regardind articles about corporations. I think Cailil's abuse of admin power is apparent in this case. The fact that he threatens to tag anyone who replaces the comments and criticisms section as a vandal is obvious, and can be seen as an abuse of admin power, voting is the generally accepted way of resolving these disputes yet he has completely ignored this and used his admin power to forward his personal agenda surrouding this article. This here is exactly what is wrong with wikipedia. Admin abuse is about the only flaw in the open source concept and project that is wikipedia. More often admins are seen as using their powers to strike back for bruised egos, or protection of their NON-neutral point of view. Wikipedia is flat out an open source project, and while the Policies are generally adhered to, even Jimmy Wales has left stuff alone when the community demanded it, no matter if it adhered to the policies. The comments and criticisms section needs to be put back into this article, I would do it myself but I cannot find it in the history section. If someone finds it but is afraid to replace it due to Cailil's threats link it to me in my user talk page. If he wants to fight with someone I will fight him, and will gladly strike back by reporting him as abusing his admin powers.	0

51209	, 2 February 2007 (UTC) Response.  Darcy said That was not a typo but he cannot know that and is merely expressing his view. He then says neither of you is helping Kitty with your comments and I wonder what that means. He accuses me of being related to Robert Murray Arbuthnot or possible conflict of interest or possible canvassing on the afd. All false. I wish the first were true. Prove it please (within four weeks) and I will donate GBP10,000 to wikipedia. I have been spending the day travelling to Crieff and frankly have more urgent fish to fry than get too involved in what I experience as ad hominem personal attacks by Darcy. Besides which they make me shake excessively. So I am going to take a pill and suggest Darcy does the same. -  22:10	0

5616	I think there's little doubt that there is taking in both directions here. More than likely the World Golf Hall of Fame used the Wikipedia article as inspiration for their own text and then an editor came in and copied over a small amount of content from their website. (Unless the earlier Wikipedia article copied from another source, which they later also used.) She was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2007 and would presumably not have entered their literature prior to that point. But the other content from that passage has been evolving in our article since it was created in 2004:  This evolved gradually and naturally into the form it was in when in August 2010 it was sources (probably circularly) to the WGHoF and the snippet of their text pasted in.  Meanwhile not all, but some of the content from that edit needs to be cleaned up a bit to comply with WP:Copy-paste. For now, I'll clumsily address it with quotation marks.  (talk)	0

84822	Ringerfan23:  I just want you to let you know that you appear to alienate a lot of people on Wikipedia.  Perhaps the problem can be best summarized by your own comment on this page when you said that you thought about the issue and came to agree with the rest of the group.  In light of your failure to think about the issue in advance, your actions were shameful.  When faced with a group of people who reached consensus, you still had the audacity to have the page locked to reflect your (poorly reasoned) point of view.  These are the actions of a stubborn child who wants his way and completely contradictory to what Wikipedia is about.  I think you should grow up, recognize that your positions are often incorrect, and defer to the democratic process.  Seriously, why do you think your opinion is so important that your beliefs should outweigh a consensus?	0

116341	"""::: Monkeykiss, Stephen I agree with you. I will ad the socio-political implications in the main section. In my opinion, the deeds (kamma)and its effect of an individual, being completely irreversible, are stored in the collective memories of others. They pass on to others and future generations through social and biological mechanisms ( books, heridity, stories, fables etc). For e.g. Hindus and Muslims are still warring because of bad deeds of Muslims committed 1000 years ago. Thus there is no need for any etheral means for transfer of kamma from one generation to another. the rebirth concept is not necessary for the transfer of kamma. Anyways atleast one thing is certain that the same person never takes re-birth again. Kamma may recoil on the doer ( if i kill, i may get killed through revenge) or it may have an impact on others ( if i take a bribe, my children will have to suffer social stigma) or it can have effect on the future generations ( if i harm the environment mindlessly, future generations will not get clean water/air). It is not necessary that in all cases the deed kamma bounces back to the doer. Still the Law of Kamma is sufficient for maintaining the moral order as the key learning is that all actions will leave an impact which is irreversible.

Why are we inviting editors at AE to engage in discussion if AE isn't the place for discussion? Obviously, that doesn't make any sense.   And, since you brought it up (not me), I strongly disagree that AE discussion is only between administrators and not between anyone else.  Admins are simply editors with an extra bit.  Any uninvolved editors have as much right to participate in the discussions as anyone else.  It is the role of admins to carry out the consensus of these discussions.  Nothing more, nothing less.	0

75336	==re-PWT== It was PWT - I've appended my reply to John Leach below. I have to admit that my students and occasionally I have goaded him but quite frankly he writes rubbish and when challanged when he was a member of the ACS, he responded with a tirade of highly offensive e-mails. By following his posts re-1728 one can see what kind of mind is at work. First Maun's book did not exist, then someone 'reliable' told him it did. He bought it and he will analyse it to see if it is any good! Now it is but John has made mistakes and he's not willing to admit it so although he knows he is posting nonsense, he continues writing some hubris regarding his sources. JohnLp - Blackjack is not a valid source. Anyone can copy out from books by McCann et al but BJ adds his own POV - pages of it. Remove it and he goes beserk. I leave you all to it because as PWT said - all the people interested don't use WP - they have the books. I worry that the whole project is becoming dominated by him and his chums. Follow AA's edits - they are enthusiastic but contain many errors. Change them and you are a sockpuppet or what ever it is - that from Leachy who's had a least a dozen. As you can imagine, at a Uni we have several severs and infinite possible user names. We have to do this because whenever we use oner BJ has it block. it's your problem on WPCric but it is serious becaUause within the next two issues, an ACS member(I am not a member) is writing a damning critique. It is a terrible shame because there are many superb entries. Many of thise by BJ are flawed, some are plain wrong. Anyhow best of luck. (I thought he was on vacation incidentally, or working! You get the drift.)  PWT I was at Trent Bridge and I asked PWT to intervene to prevent the cricket site becoming corrupted with errors and Blackjacks efforts to move the contents of his site to WP. We discussed it and contacted KW who agreed there was a chance Blackjack's personalised style of editing was perpetrating errors because he lacked the level of source we have. How sad we have from BJ more hysterical self promotion. I got a student to have a look and they think you have used at least six sock puppets yourself. What makes all this so sad is that the edits you previously posted are fully available. Quite frankly, I don't know what your problem is John. You sent highly offensive emails to PWT which we were looking at on Friday - you sent offensive emails to the editor of the Cricket Statistcian. Neither I, nor Peter have altered pre 1750 cricket with other than the correct information. If Rambling Man(similar to your own Midnight Rambler Blackjack(see his blog)) wants to block these sites he is of course able to do it. What he will be doing is to enable Blackjack/JamesJJames/Albert WM or whatever it ws and several others to become sole editor. A man who has operated multiple sock puppets and is not regarded as an authority by Peter , Keith or any of the acknowledged expert who have publish books of great authority. I know Maun's view of John but it is for him to put it forward. It was PWT who edited and in response to JohnLp added some comments. It is indicative of the thrall Blackjack has laid over half a dozen people that this project is allowing a string of entries riddled with errors that could easily be altered and referenced by those with the correct sources, carry on because for some reason he is their man. WP is about facts not opinions. See 1728 Cricket for the facts on all newspaper entries for that year. Blackjack wants those blocked who spoil his game and I can, by private email, show anyone who wishes more evidence of his approach through his communications with people who disagree with him. The John Leach(MP) wasd posted by a student but you will recall that Blackjack at one time posted his own biography. It was more accurate - marginally. I will now leave this alone completely as Mr Maun's book has sold a thousand copies which I guess are all the people interested in this project so Blackjack's work is thankfully falling on deaf eyes so to speak. And it was PWT. Dr TM Asquith	0

5305	Thanks for the speedy reply and the links. After mining through about 20 or thirty none seem to indicate a clear consensus on the issue of what is or is not a minor edit. There are some agreement regarding specific examples where the edits being made where disagreed upon such as Template redirects or date delinking but not much outside that clearly agreeing an edit as minor. As I mentioned before I still think that someone needs to establish clearly what is considered a minor edit, perhaps in a table form, that can be added too (or removed) as needed rather than a vague catch all description.  For example, after reading the many of the discussions I can see that there does seem to be agreement that removing blank spaces or changes to casing are minor and shouldn't be done alone. Aside from those 2, the rest where argued both ways and it appears that the more technical users won the arguments by force of will and access rights. I'm not trying to beat a dead horse here but I just wanted to point out that the example you gave didn't really emphasize what you were trying to convey and if anything supporterted the opposition if they had bothered to read it.	0

17978	Hi there.  Let me make my comment a little more personal.  The internet is FULL of sites like yours (which you are definitely promoting by placing these links everywhere) and access to them is so simple.  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and NOT a place to pop links in just because it's the same topic.  When the above message says to add content instead of links, it is because external links are useless to a real encyclopedia.  If possible, we try to link internally, and externally link only to resources for the articles.  There are plenty of Ronaldinho links and sites with videos that display his skills; they should not be linked here.

7650	"""Balance==  I find the balance of content in this article extremely unsatisfactory.  To introduce Badoglio's career by saying he """"was an Italian soldier, politician and alleged war criminal for the use of poison gas and systematically bombarding and strafing Red Cross hospitals and ambulances during the Ethiopia campaign. Due to post-war expediencies, however, he was never brought to justice"""" seems to miss several points entirely.  That's 5 words about his military and political career, and 36 about his activities as a war criminal.  The war criminal accusation is based entirely on one documentary source which is very short on facts and evidence.  If this war criminal accusation is true, it needs to be strengthened with names, dates and places, and some evidence of Badoglio's involvement in the events.    It seems to me far more important to stress the facts that Badoglio was one of Italy's most senior military figures during the Second World War, despite his doubts about Italy's strategic capabilities, and that he became Prime Minister after the downfall of Mussolini.  Badoglio's role in the inexplicable two months delay between July and September 1943, when Italy's future role in the war remained ambivalent while Germany rushed troops south to fortify the Italian peninsula, is the most fascinating thing about his career.  Whatever the reasons for his failure to act decisively, Badoglio's inaction condemned Italy to suffer another twenty months of grinding war.

144617	"""   Closed and Collapsed Sections   The following was deleted because it points out that people are trying to introduce legitimate criticism to this article and, rather than engage in a discussion, editors are telling these people to just go away. This is fair because?  What's been going on here is people pointing out that there is legitimate and notable criticism of her knowledge of video games, that Anita does not meet notability standards as no credible sources (nothing even close to a peer reviewed journal) have praised her work, and a bunch of long time editors have said """"No criticism allowed because she awesome! Go away!""""     The reason her work will never find its way into a psychology journal is because it is complete BS. There is a huge difference between toys made for boys and toys made for girls because corporations have done extensive market research and design to taste. It has nothing to do with a conspiracy against women that has been successful for thousands of years across every culture known to history. The fact that Anita wants girls to play games made for boys doesn't make her relevant, it makes her a fighter of reality, as well as a hypocrite.     She recently expressed her anger at video game makers for including female characters but used a bow on their heads to distinguish them, even though old school graphics left few options, and ignored the fact that modern video games are able to make females distinct in many ways. Yes, bows were used to distinguish females, because women are into accessories. They could have used, I don't know, giant hoop earrings. If Anita is as adamant as she claims, she needs to free her ears of the great patriarchy's brand and shave her head.     What about little boys who want to play with dolls and My Little Pony? They get teased much worse than girls who want to play video games made for boys. I guess that's because they're not manly enough, so it's still girls who are being oppressed.     The idea that men and women should be treated equally in the workplace is one thing but the idea that men and women don't have fundamentally different tastes, and are the victims of an ancient conspiracy to convince us all that we do, is a bunch of BS that will never be taken seriously by any professional journal. This is why Anita is an irrelevant nobody (and proven liar: """"I love video games."""" I'm not a fan of video games"""") and doesn't deserve a page beyond the incident where she played the victim and was given a bunch of money. I know, """"go away!""""209.89.84.174  """	0

66825	"""   Dubious sentence   """"Consequently, Ney now organised a combined arms (infantry, artillery and cavalry) attack on La Haye Sainte, which fell as the defending King's German Legion troops ran out of ammunition. Ney then moved artillery up to the allied centre and began to pulverise the infantry squares.[73]""""  This is the final sentence of the French Cavalry attack section.  There seem to be several things wrong with it: first, attacking a building with cavalry is pointless, be they with infantry or not, second, field artillery have little effect on reasonably stout (like Belgian farmhouses) buildings, apart from shells setting them alight (which is what happened to the Chateau de Goumont, to little effect).  I think two events are being conflated here.    Having become obvious that the cavalry on their own were achieving little, Ney organised a combined arms attack, using Bachelu's Division (Reille's Corps) and the remaining French cavalry in a fit enough state, towards the centre of Wellington's position, this was halted by the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge (who couldn't break the French infantry formations, and consequently the British cavalry then fell back). Uxbridge then tried to lead the Dutch-Belgian heavy cavalry into the attack but they refused to charge.  Meanwhile, Bachelu's men and their cavalry supports were being hard hit by artillery fire and eventually fell back themselves.    Simultaneously, or thereabouts, elements of D'Erlon's Corps renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte, and were ultimately successful.     If you can reference all of that, be bold and put it in! -    Done (I'm bloody, bold and resolute - in Shakespeare's words ;)  )    Artillery   One omission and one challenge.   We should say something about Wellington's tactic of having his gun crews seek shelter in the infantry squares during the cavalry attacks. There is also Mercer's account of not doing so because he reckoned if his men ran for the Brunswick squares next to them, the Brunswickers would run too. He gives a great eyewitness account of what happened to cuirassiers when you fired canister at them at point-blank range, too.   Now the challenge. What's the source for there being only 54 guns in the Grand Battery? French """"batteries"""" (field brigades, or companies, perhaps, more correctly) had eight guns. There should have been either 48 or 56, i.e. 6 or 7 batteries, as otherwise it would imply at least one incomplete unit, or that some weapons were detached for some reason. I don't recall any suggestion from elsewhere that that happened. Were there perhaps 54 guns east of the Brussels road?    Adkin, p. 296, has forty two 6lb, eighteen 12lb cannon, and six 6in and fourteen 5.5in howitzers - eighty pieces of ordnance in total from 10 artillery companies (of 8 pieces each).  This is for the period 1:00 to 1:30 pm.  6th Foot Artillery: 9th, 10th, 11th, 19th and 20th companies  8th                4th company  2nd                7th company  Marines of the Guard Foot Artillery: 2 companies (undifferentiated)  Old Guard Foot Artillery: 6th company.     Thanks - and those figures are consistent with what I know of French artillery organisation, i.e. each 8-gun foot artillery company had 6 guns and two howitzers. Your source shows 20 howitzers in total which says they had the howitzers of 10 companies, hence 80 guns - so it ties in. The eighteen 12-pounders would be the guns of three companies and the six 6in howitzers would have been theirs.  I wonder if someone miscounted by adding up just the guns and forgot to include the howitzers? That would get you close to 54 guns. Or perhaps 54 guns is what they had left after the Union Brigade got done with them.    I vote we change it. At present the article implies that there was a 54-gun battery which covered the entire length of Wellington's position, and that this dilution of fire accounted for its relative ineffectiveness.    By all means change it.    Format In my internet explorer is the formating of the page rather strange. The text begins very late, almost beneath the infobox.

What I have seen in the old talk before I arrived, and during the time that I have been here, is that all specialists try it work on this and leave disillustioned.        . I agree with Slrubenstein above. I have long argued that my position, Endler's position (position 1 high up in this discussion page) is a current scientific one and very closely linked with Darwin's. Excatly, it is A current one. Not THE current one. making that THE definition is WP:NOR.      It confuses because the old definitions are incorrect.   Kim, I do not see how you can say this unless you agree with Henry Ford that """"history is bunk.""""  Most people are interested in history, and there are even scientists who are interested in the history of their science.  That it confuses you does not mean (as I think is now evident) that it will confuse most readers of this encyclopedia.  They understand that things change.  They also understand that trends have beginnings.  It is simply meaningless to say """"the old definition is incorrect.""""  If you do not understand why, I urge you to read up on the philosophy of science - definitions are more or less useful.  It was that old definition that led to a line of inquiry that has led evolutionary scientists to more precise and more useful understandings of the process.  If anything, as educators we should show readers how scientists start with one formulation of natural selection and then refine it.   You know, the fact that you reject Darwin's definition of natural selection does not mean natural selection and the theory of evolution are wrong.  On the contrary, it simply means that science has a history, that scientists debate and refine concepts which necessarily change over time.  Do you think this is a trivial point?  In the United States, at least, you are dead wrong.  If you are not from the US let me tell you, there is a huge """"creationist"""" movement which has, on numerous ocassions, had the theory of evolution banned from high schools.  And you should know that one """"argument"""" they make is that Darwin was - well, as you say, """"incorrect.""""  """"See!"""" they exclaim, """"even scientists say Darwin was wrong!  We should no longer teach evolution!""""  Obviously, they misunderstand the way science works.  They do not understand that scientists refine and develop theories without necessarily rejecting them.  I think scientists have an obligation to educate people about this.  Showing how scientists accept an idea, and then change its definition or conceptualization by refining it without repudiating it is the best way to accomplish this.    |  Talk  You confuse hiding Darwin versus focusses on current usage first and add darwin's definitions in the history section.   Okay, but with all due respect, you confuse starting with Darwin for focussing on Darwin.  They aren't the same.  There are two reasons for starting with Darwin: one, it is a reasonable starting point, two, whatever differences there are between you, Axel, Marco and others, or among different scientists who have published on natural selection, all can agree that Darwin introduced the idea.  Why not just say @@@Natural selection''', as first introduced by Darwin, refered to ....  Since Darwin, evolutionary scientists have revised his definition based on new findings in genetics and molecular biology...?    |  Talk  The lead should briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it could stand on its own as a concise version of the article..

31470	"""If Canada abolished the monarchy or changed the succession rules it would have no impact on the UK. Conversely, if the UK were to change its succession rules and Canada maintained the status quo, we would be faced with the possibility of having to completely change our system to accomodate a resident monarchy - when our political system and constitution are not designed for an absentee monarch (hence the position of governor general which does not exist in the UK). TAB   The """"British monarchy"""" is """"first among equals"""" in political terms as the abolition of the monarchy in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc would have no impact on the monarchy in Britain whereas the abolition of the monarchy in the UK would almost certainly lead to its extinction in the rest of the Commonwealth Realms.  The fact is that the system in the """"Commonwealth Realms"""" (outside of the UK) was designed with the assumption that the monarch would be resident in London. Do you deny that?TAB  The fact is that the monarch is present most of the time in Britain. She has spent 2% of her reign in Canada and, I suspect, around that percentage or less in the other Commonwealth Realms.TAB  The fact is that this means there is quite a different relationship between the monarch and a) her British subjects and the British political system and b) her subjects and the political systems in the other Commonwealth realms.  The most obvious constitutional difference is that the duties and constitutional role played by the Governor General in the Commonwealth Realms is played by the Queen herself in Britain. i.e. The Queen, with increasingly rare exceptions, does not give royal assent to bills passed in Commonwealth legislatures or even give the Throne Speech (what in Britain is called the Queen's Speech because the Queen herself gives it). She does not name the Prime Ministers in Commonwealth Realms, does not resolve constitutional or parliamentary crises that may result in Commonwealth Realms and does not have weekly meetings with her Commonwealth PMs.TAB  Now monarchists like to believe that the Queen is fully informed and intimately involved in, let's say, Canadian affairs. The reality is that in the Commonwealth Realms the role of the monarchy has developed so that it is really more of an abstract and theoretical entity, much more so than in Britain.TAB  Let me give you a hard example. We now know that the Queen was not at all consulted on the dismissal of Gough Whitlam in Australia in 1975. This was done by Governor General Kerr in her name but she was not consulted or even informed until after it had happened.TAB  Let me give you another example. We now know thanks to the 30 year disclosure rule that the Prince Philip and the Prince of Wales quite regularly write letters and make phone calls to Cabinet ministers and senior bureaucrats in Britain complaining of this or that government policy (this is actually quite shocking considering all the propaganda we are fed about the monarchy being """"above politics""""). We also know from biographies and autobiographies that UK Prime Ministers do give some consideration to what the Queen thinks about this or that thing or even this or that minister. It may not be a decisive consideration but its in the picture. That is simply not the case for Commonwealth Realm PMs. There is no evidence of royals writing Canadian or Austrlain ministers complaining about this or that policy or of Canadian or Australian PMs being particularly concerned about what the Queen might think, at least not to the extent as is the case in the UK. TAB  Now you might say but the Governor General acts on HMs behalf so there's really no difference. But there is, the Queen's role in the UK is unmediated, in the realms it is mediated by a GG and she is almost a complete absentee from the process.TAB  Therefore, it's quite clear that her role is much more important in the UK than elsewhere.   Also, the fact that the systems in the Commonwealth Realms are designed with an absentee monarch in mind and have a GG in place Britain becoming a republic would have an impact on the realms where Commonwealth realms becoming republics has had no impact on the Queen's role in the UK.   The fact is if Britain became a republic the Commonwealth Realms would have to figure out which one of them would become the new home for the Windsors, or if some sort of shared custody arrangement should be worked out where, say, she spends one month in each realm.TAB  The fact is they would also have to deal with the royal family's wishes, including the possibility that they would not want to move to Canada or Australia but would prefer to either remain in a British republic as ordinary citizens or live in exile in Europe (or even the US). That would raise the possibility of abdication and having to find a new mon"	0

You only saw one side of it. That is why I left Wikipedia, got heated, and wanted to be taken off. I have contributed a lot to Wikipedia over the years – and if you take out you should put back – and that is what I try to do. I have made Hitchin Flyover from a section into a stub article for example. Not the best article, but it's a start.  I don't want the abuse any more than anyone else: but I didn't start it. Thank you for finishing it.  In the meantime there has been an investigation for sockpuppetry on this range of addresses of which I am one in Hungary. I'll try to find it for you cos my IPconfig just gives me the address of the gateway (as you'd expect) and not the landing address. But I can assure you it is not me: I have edited under IP not to avoid any ban (I had a WP:WIKIBREAK anyway while things cooled down) but it is certainly not me socking. Or if they think it is me, well the problem is solved: most of my contribs on the edit tags say SimonTrew editing as IP. I wasn't trying to avoid anything except the flak which – I think like you – I thought better to stay away and let it cool down, but still wanted to contribute to this excellent encyclopaedia which is free to everyone. It's all right for us in the first world but this is SO important to people who can't afford an encyclopaedia.  So I get it wrong sometimes but I think as we all are, I am aiming in the right direction. This should not have got so heated but I tried to cool it.	0

At WP:AN/I, you suggested a """"fresh start"""" in the context of a discussion I have not followed.  My interest is only in that term  where did it come from?  This term does not appear to be associated with any Wikipedia conventions.  Fresh start (an anti-Maastricht Treaty group within the British Conservative Party opposed to the Maastricht Treaty) and Fresh Start (detergent) (a  Colgate-Palmolive laundry product) are unrelated.  If it's just a term you've introduced in this unique setting and nowhere else, fine.  I just wondered.  I attempted to use a similar concept in a military-related setting  at Talk:Hyūga helicopter destroyer#RESET, but it fell on deaf ears.  In retrospect, it seems likely that it would have made no difference if there had been a pre-existing link to Reset (military term); but perhaps it may make a difference in future.    The political question has to do with this military term.  How do """"depoliticize"""" the article I'm about to create.  It seems likely that there may be numbers of editors and users for whom American military terminology becomes a priori political before it's even possible to reach the content threshold which implies something like your """"fresh start?""""    As a general rule, most of the new Wikipedia articles I've created have to do with pre-Meiji Japan, and this odd, overly-sensitive hesitation simply doesn't arise.  However, I'm not unaware of those critical voices on the francophone internet decrying the American bias in the World Wide Web; and I've noticed similar comments across a range of English-language Wikipedia articles.  Other than searching for British and Commonwealth military specialists in an effort to discover a congruent British and commonwealth term, can you think of something off-hand which might be relevant in creating an article which would have broader usefulness in Wikipedia contexts like you yourself created?  A further point: I really like the term """"fresh start""""  not as much as """"reset"""".  Can you foresee any reason why I shouldn't re-name the article about the British activists in the 80's as Fresh Start (British politics).  This would leave something like """"your"""" fresh start in the primary position.    Final question: When I noticed your sub-heading, my first-blush plan was to create """"Fresh start"""" as a re-direct page; but now that I think about it, maybe the perceived """"political"""" problems with an article about an American military term would be diminished if the article itself were entitled """"Fresh start""""  with """"Reset"""" as a re-direct page?

51293	Due to continual nibbling away of information by some very uninformed editors the section on current legal battle makes absolutely no sense. It appears to be remnants of longer pieces of information standing in isolation. If anyone can work out there are two trials now in progress one which started in September 2012 at the Delhi Patiala Court heard by Mr Justice Akash Jain based on a FIR filed by the Delhi Police due to her fasting at the Delhi Jantar Mantar 6 October 2006. That trial has now completed two full days of hearings the next production warrant the 14th is set for October 30-31 2014 2 days of prosecution witnesses. The second trial is in Imphal. So after her arrest on fresh charges March 2014 the Imphal Police pressed charges at that point a local corrupt lawyer turned up and decided that the best thing was for all charges to be dropped and Sharmila to be placed in a death tent where he desire to starve herself to death over a few weeks could be respected. The Chief Judicial Magistrate rejected his plea to dismiss all charges after 13 years of imprisonment because someone might ask why did you imprison her then and keep her in solitary if there was no case to answer. The lawyer then appealed to higher Court the District & Sessions Judge. When this Judge looked at the case he pointed out the prosecution hadn't actually submitted any evidence of any wrong doing other than suggesting that everybody knew she was on a fast to death. Given that following procedural rules of evidence in court no evidence was actually being presented just references to hearsay the Judge ruled that in the absence of positive evidence to suggest mens rea he didn't need to look into the validity of the actus reus of whether hunger striking was grounds for arrest under the attempted suicide legislation so he dismissed the charges adding that he felt the Government should take measures to preserve Sharmila's health because even if hte Prosecution hadn't bothered to present any evidence he knew she was on a hunger strike and would die without farther intervention. Subsequently the Government re-arrested Sharmila on a fresh charge of attempted suicide and appealed to the Manipur High Court to have the District & Sessions Judge's judgement overturned and for a trial to proceed. Meanwhile Sharmila is held at the JNIMS security ward (not house arrest because then she would be in her own home) on 15 day judicial remand. The last judicial remand renewal was 5th September (the next one is due on 19th September) the last hearing of the Manipur High Court regarding the judicial review of the previous case dismissal was 3 September when they sought more papers but it appears this is all to complicated for wiki editors so they have gone with what appear to be verifiable facts in no particular order which when read do not make any sense at all. In this they are true to the actual Indian court proceedings. Desmond Coutinho again look I have just signed my name.	0

77131	joshbuddy, your editing leaves me gasping! Your Lead-in is not only void of verification; it also presents several outright false statements, and seriously misrepresents other items.   1. The statement that “Jehovah's Witnesses teach that blood is sacred and must not be eaten or transfused whole” is grossly misleading because all Jehovah’s Witnesses do not teaching this and your statement implies all of them do. Hence this statement of yours misrepresents.   2. The statement “This view was put forward by the second president of the Watchtower Joseph Franklin Rutherford” not only lacks verification, it is just plain false. Rutherford did not teach that blood per se was sacred, and he never condemned blood transfusion.   3. The statement “Beginning in 1980, the medical use of certain products derived from blood became permissible” is not verified, and it is just plain false. Watchtower doctrine tolerated some products derived from blood as early as November of 1961, which was only ten months after blood transfusion became a shunning offence.   4. The statement “there is evidence that some Jehovah's Witnesses have secretly taken medical products derived from blood or blood transfusions” is a patent misrepresentation. Verifiable source material demonstrates that some Jehovah’s Witnesses have also openly accepted blood transfusion!   5. The statement, “The non-acceptance of blood products by groups like the Jehovah's Witnesses has caused many hospitals to offer bloodless medicine” is another horrible misconstruction. When it comes to the Watchtower organization’s blood doctrine, there is no other similar group, and you have not referenced one either.   Your statement manifests a serious lack of qualification to address this subject. You manifest ignorance of the subject, and a willingness to edit despite that lack.

That was my first Wikipedia account (I was 11 year old when I first used that account in 2009, and 14 when i lasted used it in 2012). I'm 17 years old now.  I remember when I would used to create a lot of articles, notably on actors who starred in shows that I watched (wizards of waverly place, hannah montana, etc.) We first crossed paths in 2009 (and parted ways in 2012, looking at your last edit on that account userpage), when you nominated a good number of them for deletion (some of them got deleted). If you look at the talk page on the GreenBayPackers account, you'll notice that I actually got vindicated on a good number of the articles you nominated for deletion – a lot of the articles are intact, and in fact have been expanded with pictures, more sources, etc. such as the Harry Shum and Simon Curtis article. I forgot the password to that account, and later used sockpuppets (which I remember you blocked me for, lol). So, how have you been? I've been well. I've started editing a broad multitude of articles productively (I'd argue I was editing productively with that other account as well, and that you were being a tad overzealous).

18822	Having looked more closely at the initial references you linked me to (before even glancing at the latest ones) I now realize that they are multiple and all say the same thing, so I've redacted what I had originally said about it possibly being a typo - one or two typos are possible, consistently being wrong multiple times is not.  All I can state is that the novel has Elphinstone as the rank I stated, but quite possibly that was a literary tweak in order to make Christian the only Master's Mate. I'm certainly not going to claim the fictional variant is correct and all the non-fictional versions are wrong! Now that I look at Elphinstone's and Churchill's ages, Elphinstone (at 36) is 8 years older than Churchill (at 28) so it is unlikely, but by no means impossible, that Elphinstone was junior in rank to Churchill.  To be honest, I'm a bit confused why there would be 2 Master's Mates on the same ship with so small a crew - is that normal?  That would make it the only rank on the Bounty for which there was more than one instance other than quartermaster (and of course, able seaman!).  Anyway, I don't want to get stuck on this issue - I had asked who you the other Master's Mate was and you told me. My response to your reply is now a bit of a digression, but hopefully an informative one. Let's move on. Granted that Elphinstone is indeed a Master's Mate, the number of crew not berthed in the forecastle in point (5) below is now 15 not 14, which is still greater than 13. 66.16.144.18	0

80369	Security in Ubuntu   Apparmor is only configured to protect the printing system by default, I think that if they want to get preachy about security, then the place to start is the 14 or so vital, critical, system daemons that can obliterate the system if a malicious user is able to usurp them, Red Hat, Fedora and security conscious distributions actually protect their users with SELinux, which isn't completely worthless, as AppArmor pretty much is.  Case in point, you write a profile in AppArmor, I come along and symlink the resource you're trying to protect, and BAM, I have just rooted your box...AppArmor is as much protection from being hacked or from a malicious local user, as putting a wet paper bag over your head while a nuclear bomb is going off.  Another thing Noobuntu is infamous for is crippling SU (substitute user), sudo on a server is unwieldy and selling sudo on security is basically snake oil, Ubuntu sets you up with root-like permissions anyway, and doesn't make any attempt to tech you how to limit other users access to the system appropriately.  Anyway, with that, and more.  I do not feel you could call Ubuntu a secure operating system, most of that crap wouldn't even stop a script kiddie.

(b) or (c) seem to be reasonable, popular choices. This is something that people are just going to have to think hard about and come to a consensus.  What is OR depends on what we decide the article is about, since it is clear that we are using """"ghetto benches"""" a bit figuratively.  Changing the title is a possibility. Under (c), but probably not (b), the replacement from the notes that I suggested, the quote from Meltzer -""""In fact, ever since the attainment of independence, the universities in Poland had been strongholds of Endejca supporters and centers for anti-semitic agitation.” would be acceptable.

27575	Thanks for your comments to the scoring system. It was, if you can see, for the first 2 rounds, the first person who gets the correct answer received a times-infinity bonus because all others are given 0 points. My work with the current scoring system is to encourage people to KEEP ANSWERING after somebody has got correct, and as the same time KEEP the privilege of the first correct-getter. As you can see, owing to this new scoring system, the amount of answer-scripts have risen dramatically. I wonder if the 1-extra-point system will bring any negative effect to the future competitions. It is because each question carries different amount of points, and the first-answer will lose his or her advantage. Instead, I suggest that a multiplier is to be kept instead of replacing it with an addition.  Also, to encourage more replies, I've also given bonus multipliers to the second and third persons who get the correct answer. So what I think after hearing your opinion is, to keep the multiplying system, but the multiplier may be reduced from *4, *2, *1.5 to something like *2, *1.5, *1.2 (something greater than 1 but not greater than 1.5).

62104	"""  Hi Darius, a part of the reason I think the genocide looms so large, and deserves space in a 3 paragraph summary is because it is still a """"big deal"""" and current event topic.  There are laws being drafted in Turkey restricting freedom of speech on this issue even as they try to join the E.U.  Major motion pictures like Ararat which cover the genocide cannot be shown in Turkey, sometimes due to the government, sometimes due to terrorist threats.  So perhaps when there is an admission, and the topic fades out, the time will have come to relegate this solely to the history pages.  Meanwhile, no two genocides are alike, but the Armenian/Jewish ones have a great deal in common.  The scale of both surpassed a million, both ended in the murder of over half the population and expulsion of the rest, both were done under cover of world war, both had nationalistic and religious overtones, while targetting a minority known for industriousness and wealth, and the similiarities go on.  The """"neutrality"""" of information has only been an issue because unlike post-war Germany, which was thoroughly defeated, Turkey, which had signed a treaty of Sevres which stipulated an independent Armenia who's borders were drawn by President Wilson of the USA instead had an internal revolution, changing all their treaties so as not to even mention Armenia ONCE, and then began a massive government campaign to rewrite history.

However in retrospect this does not seem to be the case entirely, and I will be reviewing the page shortly.  Just a quick point on 'Edio*Magica', although it wasn't you who blocked me directly, it was still rather silly to think I would vandalize the very pages I have been improving (Sooty & co., The Brittas Empire), and to think that I would replace content with insults directed at myself. Due to the blocking I had to create this new account in order to edit pages, but I'm willing to forgive and forget about the misunderstanding.    It wouldn't be the first time that someone has disrupted Wikipedia. In the past, we've had people create vandalism on one account, so that they can look good on another by fighting it.

There are a few manuscripts in the Bibliothèque nationale de France that seem to be survivors of the Siirt library.   The Assyrian tribes template could simply be made dormant (de-linked from articles with a note saying why that's been done) until you feel that you can include more complete articles on the tribes. The Nochiya Tribe article looks good. Being a syriacist, the only thing I noticed was that, in the ethnic groups template, the header says Nochiyayeh, but the script underneath says Nochiya — you need an extra yud zlami-pshuqi before the final alap. I agree with you that it would be good to have an article about the geographic homeland of Assyrians. However, it would be have to be carefully and named. You are right in suggesting the article Kurdistan as a good model, as it has avoided all sorts of attacks by those who suggest that it infringes the sovereignty of other nations. Also, even though modern Assyrians celebrate descent from the ancient Assyrians, we need to keep the articles seperate, as they are talking about two very different historical periods. Perhaps it would be good to have an article an article on Assyrian homeland that could be linked from the Assyria article in a dablink. —	0

I love simplicity, just won't surrender it unless clarity isn't thrown out with the bathwater. As I said, I'm content. Explaining the """"nearest 50 years"""" rule is great. ) Also, I was going to explain the contents were only as specific as chapter. You have done this in a very neat and clear way, thank you! Great to have you at work on things! Yes, I thought about linking the books or not. The main argument against was that it took so long to enter them! However, the point of linking every repeated entry in a sortable list imo is that people may sort on city, for example, to see manuscripts near their home, say. If they see that Thessalonians is in a university library 125 miles away, maybe they will click on the link to Thess to see what Wiki editors have said about the book. Instead of looking for the first instance of Thessalonians in the table, or trying to decipher the abbreviation they just click on the field in the record they are looking at. I agree about not over-Wiki-ing, especially in the body of an article, and especially if different words are given the same link. Tables, by their nature are speedy reference systems, I like the idea of giving people just one click to follow up locating a record of interest. One example of how I might use the table is to add a """"Textual criticism"""" section to articles on NT books that don't have one already. I'd sort the table by the Contents field (I know it's not perfect), view the data relevant to a book and click through to it. Another use is to check just what 1 Corinthians chapters 10-11 contain. That article actually has links to specific chapters. Some of us know what's in chapters, most won't. Though, admittedly, not all articles on NT books go to specifics on chapters, but maybe in time they will. Now the work is done, it seems like a pity to lose it.

With this definition, China, Philippines and Japan are """"states"""". The terms """"state"""", """"nation"""" and """"country"""" refer to concepts which may be similar, however still have their small distinctions. In order to avoid ambiguity, it's better to refer to objects such as China, Japan, Britain, Russia, the United States, France, et cetera as sovereign states, instead of the two alternative terms. A sovereign state is largely defined in modern contexts based on Westphalian sovereignty, whilst the definitions of nation and country differ depending on various contexts.I wouldn't put too much thought on what the Chinese Wikipedia says on this issue. The Chinese language, like all languages, has its limitations in that there is no one-to-one correspondence with English political vocabulary.

We can't say, for example, that it is caused by a severe deficiency of Vitamin C because that would simply be false. But in the case of the men's rights movement there are all sorts of descriptions, ones used by """"scholars"""" no less, that would not be false.

It seems you have moved the mastersock to Ichek, but I would say that Techastrax is a different sock despite sharing similarities with the currently suspected socks and Ichek.

70979	"""    kinda.  I'll partially reverse that, for three reasons.  The main one stems from the argument I'm having on Wrestlemania XXVIII vis-a-vis the Daniel Bryan cash-in and the concept that appears to be getting rammed down my throat of WP:Crystal, even though I have demonstrated that not to be the case over there.  If putting Bryan, by the nature of the program and at this point and time, on the Mania XXVIII card is WP:Crystal, then the concept of the strippage and any Raw title match in Hampton, VA tomorrow night (7/25) is also, technically, WP:Crystal as well.  This redoubles when you look at the second reason.  We now know that SOMETHING is going on between Punk and WWE, and that this grand angle is going a fairly new and viral direction.  Still, end of the day, we can't source that he's under contract, but they are keeping it well under wraps.  The third reason is a timeline continuity-break in the storyline.  The best I can say (and what I posted today) is that the current title status is unknown.  Consider the following from the storyline:  The Board meeting which ended McMahon's tenure took place several hours before McMahon announced the tournament.  So, is the tournament valid?  Is the final valid?  Now, consider the timeline of the """"questionable decisions"""" involved.  Is the lifting of the suspension valid if the """"fire Cena"""" stipulation is not?  Is Cena the champ?  Is Punk the champ?  Is Alberto del Rio also #1 Contender on top of Senor Dinero el en Banco?  Is the Rey/Miz tournament final valid?  We have a storyline continuity break which probably will be addressed on the 7/25 RAW.  But, as of the moment, the entire current status is unknown.  Punk may well be entitled to this entire week as champion, or not even be entitled to a reign at all (though we do have official sourcing, as of the moment, to clear that entitlement for the moment)!  Anything else gets to WP:Crystal material as far as some are concerned here.    """	0

8592	"""  I would be glad to, Noformation. A conflict of interest is defined as """"Where advancing outside interests is more important to an editor than advancing the aims of Wikipedia"""". The aims of Wikipedia is to produce a """"neutral, reliably sourced encyclopedia"""". My position is that editors from the rational-skeptic wikiproject and their ilk are NOT neutral in this subject, and in fact are incapable of being neutral because they do not have any hands on empirical experience with acupuncture, no specialist dedicated learning in it, have not taken the time to grapple with the unique and complex paradigm that contextualizes it, and thus their knowledge of it is incomplete and immature, and they are ill-equiped to provide a full, rounded, mature and neutral synthesis of the information available on this topic.  Now, as for myself, I will tell it straight, I work 12~15 hours per week in acupuncture practice, earning $35 per hour. Acupuncture practice is not my main source of income, in fact my only purpose for practicing acupuncture is to deepen my understanding of the art and sharpen my skills in it. It requires 10,000 hours of purposeful practice to become a master of any discipline, and one day I aim to achieve mastery in this discipline.  I refute the suggestion that those people who are most qualified, have the most experience, have done the most study, and are most knowledgeable and passionate about this subject should be excluded from editing on the grounds of COI. In fact these are the ones whose input is most valuable, far more valuable than the input of ivory-tower rational skeptics who only bother to attempt to understand acupuncture through a theoretical, critical and dismissive point of view. In fact, considering the tone of most editors on the acupuncture talk page, which emulates the tone of those """"Quackwatch"""" websites that proliferate on the web these days, and considering their devoted following of Edzard Ernst and their elevation of his work as the number 1 source on the page (literally), and their transparent agenda of """"de-bunking"""" the """"pseudo-science"""" they consider acupuncture to be, it rather seems to an objective observer that is those editors who are """" advancing outside interests"""" rather than being neutral, and thus they in breach of COI, as opposed to I.

That is just plain out bias it not my fault that other people do not do this when creating a record label studio album discography, which they can and you have not seen one with a color scheme on them. All I have done is put the 3 basic colors Black, Red and White of Roc Nation on a original Wikipedia column to distinguish it from other record label albums discography and the other names of the artists that are on the article, because the article would grow as those and more artist release more studio albums and mixtapes, which makes it appropriate and not inappropriate as you have stated for you reason of adding cleanup/reorganize tags. Once again all I did is add 3 basic colors to the original columns Black, Red and White which anybody can do on any other record label discographies on Wikipedia, but I may have been the first to do this new color scheme styling of a record label studio album discography that does not mean you just add tags that are not meant to be on a specific article that is formatted, organized and written like any other record label albums discographies on Wikipedia and is fully verified.  There is no Wikipedia rule that says this is not justified for a record label studio album discography except for you , I'm sure you're a really nice guy, but this just plain bias, which Wikipedia does not condone from established editors or administrators.	0

158814	A lot depends on how the various companies have set themselves up financially. Companies that have committed themselves to buy feedstock or wafers at high prices for the next several years are going to have bigger problems than those who have some flexibility in their contracts, for example. It will also depend on how their lines are set up on how reliant they are on manual labor (on cell production lines at large manufacturers I think you will find little reliance on manual labor in either country). But regardless, a tariff would push PV prices up just as they're finally beginning to come down. I don't that's a good idea. I also don't think it would have the desired effect. I don't have any figures on how much PV the US imports from China, but some 3.5% of US PV exports go to China.

It is also about reality - and as usual, people here are trying to make Wikipedia into an alternative universe rather than an encyclopedia.

Problem solved. By arbitrarily deciding on a numbering system that is contrary to what actually exists in the real world, you are using original research, which some people here tend to frown upon. As far as the problem of younger people not understanding the numbering: even today's young people are capable of working out the logic behind something with two different """"sides"""" being numbered differently.

102563	Gaijin42 inserted fake statistics into the Defensive Gun Use article and Removed the accurately cited statistics I added   His references do not say what he says they say. He is unable to produce a quoted citation showing the 33 million figure. He is making it up. If you want to have an encyclopedia with made up facts, where someone can add a figure of 33 million that they invented and which isn't in the article, please go ahead. But I don't think that's an encyclopedia anymore. As for me, I added a cited , with inline citations reference showing that there are only 1600 verified DGUs yearly. Not only that, Gaijins claim is not logically possible. Any elementary logic shows that what he is claiming is impossible. Think about what you are doing in allowing a vandal like Gaijin to insert fake statistics into articles to suit a political agenda when he has already been topic banned from this area and was just reinstated. He is indeed committing fraud by inserting statistics that aren't in the reference. Also, his reference is 20 years old and is intellectually discredited years ago.

5812	"""Ekantik, do you believe that Sathya Sai Baba can miraculously transform his genitals? I would appreciate an answer.  I also find it amusing that Ekantik, of all people, is attempting to point out strange beliefs held by Sai Devotees when Ekantik is a Hare Krishna Congregational Member and a Gaudiya Vaishnava who has openly defended his belief that Lord Krishna literally manifested 16,000 seperate human forms, married 16,000 seperate women, copulated with each one of them and generated innumerable offspring. Sanjay also believes that Lord Krishna held an entire mountain aloft on his pinky finger for 7 days and nights and defends scriptures that say the Lord Vishnu (a male) transformed himself into a woman (Mohini Devi). So it appears that Ekantik and Sai Devotees are not really that different as far as strange beliefs and miracle stories are concerned. I can't help to wonder why Ekantik mocks strange beliefs when he holds them himself.  Funny how Ekantik and Andries (critics of Sathya Sai Baba) want to promote """"well sourced"""" stories about gential switch tales and think the aura reference (written by a doctor in a well known Sri Lankan newspaper) is not """"well sourced"""".

Ergo, 70 years of nations serving Babylon began in 609. Babylon replaced the Assyrian world power in 609.

You will need to discuss at the article's Talk pages to reach a concensus, however there are no mainstream sources in support of your views.    Agreed. I've reverted you again.    You are both misinformed. According to the Cyrus Cylinder, Cyrus conquered Babylon in October 539 B.C.E. Cyrus’ first regal year began in the spring of 538 B.C.E. This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E. or “the seventh month (Tishri)” as Ezra 3:1 says.  It is a simple matter of counting back 70 years which brings us to 607 BCE for Jerusalem’s destruction. Dates other than 607 BCE ignore the statements in Scripture that the land would be desolate for 70 years. (Daniel 9:1,2)      Looking at your other edits I'm concerned that you don't have any grasp yet of WP:NPOV. I've raised them at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Bible#Editor changes biblical dates, etc where I hope you will explain your edits. You are also failing to use WP:Edit summaries, which is sufficient reason for many people to revert you.     Thank you for the reminder concerning the """"edit summaries"""" field.     You said: This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E.. That is wrong. The JW conclusion that the Jews 'must' have returned the following year is entirely speculative. Josephus explicitly states that the temple foundations were laid in Cyrus second year, which means the Jews were back in his first year, which means Cyrus decree was made at the beginning of hist first year, and the Jews then had 6 months to make the 4-month journey back to Jerusalem.    Argumentum assertio does not a valid substitute for actual evidence make. Try again."	0

151624	""". Whilst I feel that this is probably diverting into a debate rather than discussing the article, I do think this reveals one of the fundamental flaws with this article.  It bases its observations, which IMHO verge at the very least on Original research, on how a particular country implements its digital TV system. For example, GeorgeFormby1 misses a great deal of context about the British situation which is relevant here, such as:  Digital TV in the UK is strongly influenced by Freeview (and its soon to be launched sister Freesat), which are subscription free digital TV systems that the BBC (the UK's very dominant (compared to the US) public broadcaster is the key stakeholder in.  As pointed out by , Freeview boxes now retail at around £20 (actually around $40).  Although, it may seem a lot to pensioners in the US it is small compared to the annual, compulsory, Television licence fee of around £130per year ($260).  Europe has traditionally had a much stronger regulatory framework with regards to broadcasting.  Where as, (if i understand correctly) in the US, cities are well served and rural areas often poorly served (in some cases having to pay to have affiliates and stations from other markets relayed to them so they can actually have a TV service at all), most of the traditional """"analogue"""" channels in the UK and Europe(in the UK: BBC1, BBC2, ITV, C4 and to a slighlty lesser extent Five, whose availability is constrained by the amount of bandwidth that was left in Europe by the time it started in 1997)  are obliged as part of their licence to be available universally i.e. In the UK, >98% coverage of the UK landmass.  This means that European airwaves tend to be very crowded and together with the stronger licensing rules means that there are relatively few analogue channels (UK homes get 4 or 5 channels, and 6 in a *small* number of cities, where (usually) community groups are given a *low* power licence.)  The above therefore identifies the reason why a lot of European countries had an appetite for more channels when digital TV came along.  The restricted space available, particularly terrestrially, has meant that channels tend to be crammed into the available space, and indeed some digital channels have a very poor picture quality compared to a good analogue signal.  But this only tells half the story, implementations vary even in one country, for example in the UK compare the bit-rates of BBC1 digital are at about ~6Mbps compared to those on Mux A which run at <2Mbps (e.g. Five Life et al).  Thus, the resultant picture quality is purely down to the implementation,  that various multiplex owners have chosen to take and is not indicative of digital TV in general.  Indeed, as I understand in the US, where homes generally have a much greater number of channels but are """"afflicted"""" with the inferior NTSC system.  The application of digital TV has generally been to deliver HDTV as opposed to large quantities of new channels... ... and indeed that brings the question of what it is all for! In the UK and Europe large swathes of digital space are reserved for the public broadcasters (without getting into a debate over whether all this space is used for programming that is truely public service), post digital switch-over this will allow every home in the UK to access free-to-air and  terrestrially (the way most people receive TV in the UK) channels such as BBC Parliament (coverage of parliament), BBC News 24 (likely to be the UK's only free-to-air rolling news channel before long), BBC Four (""""high brow"""" arts and culture), Teachers TV (a channel for Teachers), etc, etc,.

92089	Support - This has developed into more than an uprising, how much blood has to spill before the folks who oppose the name change can call this a war? Reports from CNN that 46 people were killed on Monday. As we discuss this, the Syrian Armed forces (Army, Republican Guard, etc.) are trading hot rounds of lead with the Free Syrian Army. Also, a neighborhood was shelled and snipers continue hunt activists like they're animals. I read from Yahoo News that 9 soldiers from the Syrian Army (pro-Assad) were killed and many more wounded, the same day 46 others (anti-Assad) were killed. Therefore it's clear there has become a constant exchange in gunfire and violence overall. I think you can either call this a Civil War or perhaps a Revolution, but it's quite clear (to me at least) that the uprising is over and Syria is now a war zone. After months of violence that ranged from smaller domestic disurbances to riots with people being killed, the United States decides to close their embassy and get all of their diplomats out of the country. Why now and not earlier? This is another sign that things are getting worse. I believe the United States has enough intelligence in the country to know what's going, war has started and it was time for the U.S. to get any Americans in the country out of harms way.	0

The ballot on a possible constitution ban failed narrowly. The only failure case in USA !  The bold formatting could also be contrued as POV, since it doesn't necessarily appear in the source documentation.  As for the linking, there is absolutely no reason to link each and every state to the DOMA Watch and HRC. A single link to each organization at the end of the article is sufficient and keeping with guidelines. Another example of overlinking is the link to Alabama Constitution. That article contains nothing relevant to SSM and that puts it out of context. There's also no need to link to both the entire state constitution and the specific section that pertains to this article. The code or statute links are also duplicated in the generalities links, which is all duplicated by including the full text. This supposed to be summaries. I hope that gives you enough to get started.	0

Psychological Reports, 80, 851-860 Lynn R. and Vanhanen T., 2002, IQ and the Wealth of Nations, Westport, CT: Praeger. [Online Table] Demetriou, A., 2005, The architecture, dynamics, and development of mental processing: Greek, Chinese, or Universal?, Intelligence, 33, 109-141 I would be happy to link to any of these primary sources instead, and I think Buj is the correct one, right? So I would like the footnote to read:  Buj (1981), some of the data can be found at Greek IQ Any objections? 2 July 2005 13:38 (UTC) 15 point catholic/protestant gap In the same section The difference between the neighboring white Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland is as large as the differences between whites and blacks in the U.S.[6] Now, footnote [6] is again an external link (to Myth: some ethnic groups have genetically inferior IQ's (sic)), but that web page is much harder to navigate.

(surat an-Nur verse 31). All those in whose presence a woman is not obliged to practice the dress code are known to be her mahrams. Men have a dress code which is more relaxed: the loins must be covered from knee to waist. The rationale given for these rules is that men and women are not to be viewed as sexual objects.  Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country, has laws against these dress codes in schools and work places. After the declaration of the Republic in 1923, as part of revolutions brought by Ataturk, a modern dress code was encouraged. It is against the law to wear a head scarf while attending public school in Turkey, as well as France, where the recently enacted rule caused huge public controversy.""""  Is anyone implying that Turkey obliges women to show their naked chests and display their 'adornments'? Turkey only banned the BURQA, and it can be argued that the Quran never specifically perscribed that particular dress anyway.  """	0

81962	Abortion One of the most difficult questions facing the right to life concerns the precise definition of the term ‘human life’- when exactly does ‘life’ begin and end? This controversial issue has its focus with the exact point of the commencement of human life. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it would be accorded the ‘right to life’ under the constitution. Thus, laws concerning abortion would effectively be rendered unconstitutional.  In Singapore, the Penal Code lays out the sanctions imposed if one does not comply with the Termination of Pregnancy Act- which limits abortion to patients who have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. In Malaysia, the Penal Code states that abortion is permissible within 120 days of conception, only if the pregnancy were to pose a threat to an expecting mother’s physical or mental health.  This shows that in these two jurisdictions, the states are unwilling to confer the ‘right to life’ to fetuses younger than the stipulated periods. The legislation there has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expecting mothers who are threatened by their unborn child, and made provisions for their survival.[FIND YOUR JOURNAL^^]  This is in contrast with the approach taken in other modern jurisdictions, such as the Philippines, which provides that the state shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception. The Czech Republic also states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. It is notable that the latter two jurisdictions have a predominatly Catholic majority, who are staunchly pro-life. Therefore, chances of a  universal concensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.[PROF**]  Suicide	0

77333	"""   Wikipedia Ambassador update!   Hi! You're getting this message because you are or have been a Wikipedia Ambassador. A new term is beginning for the United States and Canada Education Programs, and I wanted to give you an update on some important new information if you're interested in continuing your work this term as a Wikipedia Ambassador.   You may have heard a reference to a transition the education program is going through. This is the last term that the Wikimedia Foundation will directly run the U.S. and Canada programs; beginning in June, a proposed thematic organization is likely to take over organizing the program. You can read more about the proposal here.  Another major change in the program will take effect immediately. Beginning this term, a new MediaWiki education extension will replace all course pages and Ambassador lists. (See Wikipedia:Course pages and Help:Education Program extension for more details.) Included in the extension are online volunteer and campus volunteer user rights, which let you create and edit course pages and sign up as an ambassador for a particular course.  If you would like to continue serving as a Wikipedia Ambassador — even if you do not support a class this term — you must create an ambassador profile. If you're no longer interested in being a Wikipedia Ambassador, you don't need to do anything.  Please do these steps as soon as possible First, you need the relevant user rights for Online and/or Campus Ambassadors. (If you are an admin, you can grant the rights yourself, for you as well as other ambassadors.) Just post your rights request here, and we'll get you set up as quickly as possible.  Once you've got the ambassador rights, please set up at a Campus and/or Online Ambassador profile. You can do so at: Special:CampusAmbassadorProfile Special:OnlineAmbassadorProfile  Going forward, the lists of Ambassadors at Special:CampusAmbassadors and Special:OnlineAmbassadors will be the official roster of who is an active Ambassador. If you would like to be an Ambassador but not ready to serve this term, you can un-check the option in your profile to publicly list it (which will remove your profile from the list).  After that, you can sign on to support courses. The list of courses will be at Special:Courses. (By default, this lists """"Current"""" courses, but you can change the Status filter to """"Planned"""" to see courses for this term that haven't reached their listed start date yet.)  As this is the first term we have used the extension, we know there will be some bugs, and we know the feature set is not as rich as it could be. (A big wave of improvements is already in the pipeline. And if you know MediaWiki and could help with code review, we'd love to have your help!) Please reach out to me (Sage Ross) with any complaints, bug reports, and feature suggestions. The basic features of the extension are documented at Wikipedia:Course pages, and you can see a tutorial for setting up and using them here.  Communication and keeping up to date In the past, the Education Program has had a pretty fragmented set of communication channels. We're trying to fix that. These are the recommended places to discuss and stay up-to-date on the education program:  The education noticeboard has become the main on-wiki location for discussion of the Education Program. You can post there about broad education program issues as well as issues with individual courses.  The Ambassadors Announce email list is a very low-traffic announcements list of important information all Ambassadors need to be aware of. We encourage all Ambassadors (and other interested Wikipedians) to subscribe to the list; follow the instructions on the link to add your email address.  If you use IRC regularly, or need to try to reach someone immediately, the  IRC channel is the place to find me and fellow Ambassadors.  Ambassador training and resources We now have an online training for Ambassadors, which is intended to be both an orientation about the Wikipedia Ambassador role for newcomers and the manual for how to do the role. (There are parallel trainings for students and for educators as well.)  Please go through the training if you feel like you need a refresher on how a typical class is supposed to go and where t"	0

It may not in fact be the same wind, there being in the old days no way to call what is now Alberta and let 'em know the tropical air mass was on its way over; all I know is the term IS part of the marine and weather lexicons in BCand, at least, in Whatcom County (where KVOS-TV 12 is, one of the stations who use the term).  As fort the directional thing, it's pretty clear with the Prairie version of the wind that the direction """"from the country ofthe Chinooks"""" IS the origin, especially when you consdier that the fur traders' HQ on the Pacific Slope was in Chinook territory (Fort Vancouver).  The directional thing on the coast is clear if you've ever seen a satellite video of a Chinook, which looks like a big thick band of white cloud streaming in from the general direction of Hawaii, but more specifically SSW even SSWxS, pretty much in a line over the Olympic Peninsula, Greater Victoria, andheadingto into Greater Vancouver from the direction of Tsawswassen, which incientally if you draw back in scale you can see is also roughly the direction of the mouth of hte Coluymbia, i.e. the coujntry of the Chinooks.  But compass-exact directions aren't hte issue, nautical ones are.  And it so happens that Chinooks arriving in Nuu-chahb-nuolth teritory would be coming from the southwest, i.e. around C ape Flattery, but nobody in those days was splitting hairs like you are; they came to use the term Chinook to mean a warm wet wind from that general direction.  The same as Squamish (wind) means a cold, harsh northerly outflow wind, which in the Georgai Strait/nortthern Puget Sound happens to be from the north and the direction of the country of the Skxwu7mesh people at what is now the town of Squamish.  Anyway, aside from all that, I've vgot requests in to Gobal, CBCand other weriters I know of hoping for a proper cite or at least a news item from the vancouver sun.  I don't care about your objections, you're just plain wrong.  And if Canadian meteorologic usage hasnt' included this term, it's their fault, not those of the BC broadcasters who still use it (""""still"""" because it dates back to the old days); it's nopt the first time that Canadian publications of any kiknd have omitted BC  perspectives or simply gotten things all wrong.  And if you ask a Chinook person, you'll find out that the correct pronunciation of the original word IS """"Tshinuk""""; the Albertan prononciation is a frenchified affectation..  """	0

Many readers will come to this page, read the headings and skip straight to the contraversy section. Without differentiating in a small way my two points, we risk the reader coming away with a very biased view of stem cell research as a whole.   It is a defect of this article that it talks too much about “cures” which indeed gives a biased view. The controversy section is best kept short, as there is a main article.  I agree, the Controversy section is best kept short, not incorrectly biased and lacking information, as it currently stands.   The controversy is that some people think that it is immoral to use cells from embryos that will be put in the trashcan otherwise. That is all there is to it.  Your anaolgy is about as crass as saying """"oh look, theres a dead body there, lets use it for fertilizer, after all, its dead"""". Whilst you might not agree with that analogy, it is roughly how many people would view your point. Your opinion whilst well informed isn't any more right then someone else who adheres to a different belief system. And thank you for clarrifying that it is indeed a contraversial issue. As a side note """"some people"""" covers a large portion of the people on this planet.   No, because those embryos really do end in trash cans, whatever the whish of the family be. This is the general rule, whereas found bodies end up in the morgue, then are incinerated if not claimed. And the ashes are indeed used as fertiliser in this case. It might seem crass to say so, but it is still the truth.   Stem cell research should be legalized everywhere. What would happen to people if they had any of their body part burned or worse?

It began in the early 16th century when King Henry VIII failed to receive an annulment from the Vatican and subsequently broke English Christianity away from the pope and declared himself the absolute spiritual ruler of the Church of England. He then proceeded on a campaign to persecute and murder all who opposed his personal claim to the """"English papacy."""" Things only went downhill from there. In subsequent generations the throne passed between Catholic and Protestant heirs, each persecuting their political enemies. The final result came under Queen Elizabeth I which settled England as a Protestant country. In the following centuries, England became the leading herald of anti-Catholic propaganda around the world, as the British crown persecuted Irish Catholics and waged war against the Catholic kingdoms of France and Spain.""""  """"Sadly, the more things change the more they stay the same. The world may have moved into the 21st century, but British politics is still locked in the 16th century. To date Catholics are still forbidden from the British royal family. Government officials still mock the pope and the Church behind closed doors. Leading party officials not only refuse to defend the pope's right of innocence until proven guilty, but actually participate in promoting anti-Catholic presumption. Way to go England!

(or, do you not concede that, hypothetically, a VALID, proper rule can be MISINTERPRETED and/or MISAPPLIED?).  Merely citing the RULE is pointless, when the problem is the misinterpretation or misapplication of the rule!  Further, Dodo violated WP rules, by not allowing a consensus of the group to develop.  He also misapplied a rule, claiming that something I said must be 'verifiable'.  But what does it mean, to be 'verified'?  Dodo implied that what I said must be verifiably, scientifically TRUE.  I claim, quite to the contrary, that since the article involved is 'Jim Bell' (subject, ME), that the only 'verifiability' issue is this:  Did 'James Dalton Bell' ACTUALLY make these claims.  (Or, conversely and hypothetically, 'is someone else forging his identity?, etc.)   For example, there was no need to RUSH and delete my posts.  Rather, somebody (preferably, one familiar with LOGIC) could have said, """"Bell, how do we know that 'you', 'jimdbell@q.com', is in fact the 'jim bell' (James Dalton Bell) who is the subject of the 'Jim Bell' WP article?  We need to be able to VERIFY the fact that 'jim bell' actually said/did this."""" (To ensure that 'jim bell' is not being libelled by a stealth forgery.) In response, I would have immediately said, """"Good question!""""  And I could have promptly proceeded to do whatever was necessary to establish this fact.  Perhaps I could also have donated a recent (current!) photograph to the article, which (of course) could be compared with other published (even if not public domain) photographs which are available on the web.    But as John Belushi was so fond of saying, 'BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO!'  Rather than HELP a 'newbie' (to WP), AND wait for a consensus, and actually help VERIFY that 'jimdbell@q.com' is actually, 'jim bell', Dodo decided to be an ass and repeatedly delete my edits.  And, he deleted ALL my edits, not merely some portion which (allegedly) was not 'verifiable'.  I will give an example, to the contrary:  I also posted a claim that I accused the Feds of forgery in a criminal appeal case, 99-30210.  In fact, in June 2003 I wrote a lawsuit (195 pages) which has (I believe) LONG been posted on the Web.  (Probably Cryptome/JYA).  It (as I recall) makes exactly this accusation.  So, if Dodo had actually acted INTELLIGENTLY, he would have edited my edit to cite my lawsuit, which has been posted for perhaps 5+ years.  (Or, he would have said to me, """"Bell, you need to show a cite of your lawsuit..."""").  THAT would have been productive, useful, and helpful.  (As opposed to being hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.)   So, why didn't Dodo do THAT?!?   The answer is quite simple:  Dodo is hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.  He's a 'control freak'.  (Apparently, WP attracts 'control freaks'.)  Rather than being assisting, supportive, and helpful, Dodo wants to slap around newbies who upset his apple cart.   """	0

You've also quite erroneously mixed up what wikipedia policy says about definitions.  The intent is to prevent extremely short articles, and for them, it suggests that you extend them.  It also tries to group very related terms together.  Chinese Republic is related to different things, depending on the context of where a person might have read about it or what point of view the person is coming from.  Republican China, for example, we agreed to point to History of the ROC since it is most appropriate for someone looking for something about .  But for someone who says Chinese Republic means the ROC exactly, we can't point him there, we have to point him towards ROC.  And then there's the third definiton that means something else entirely.	0

So why then can't we eliminate simplified chinese from the TW related articles as TW's de facto standard is traditional chinese only? Wiki is not a chinese dictionary, so is there any reason to include TW and PRC's writing systems in the articles of the other?

After a business trip to Milan, Italy, he tried to get ownership (including Gerry Baldwin) to offer traditional espresso beverages in addition to the whole bean coffee, leaf teas and spices they had long offered. After a successful pilot of the cafe concept, the owners refused to roll it out company-wide and Howard Schultz started his own coffee shop named Il Giornale in 1985. Two years later, the original Starbucks management were forced to focus on Peet's Coffee & Tea because of bullying and harrassment and sold its Starbucks retail unit to Schultz and Il Giornale. The former owners do not speak favorably of Schultz in interviews to this day.  Schultz renamed Il Giornale with the Starbucks name and aggressively expanded Starbucks' reach across the United States. It can be said that Starbucks popularized espresso drinks such as the cafe latte to many Americans who had previously only ever tasted freeze dried coffee.They later acquired HEAR music and formed Concord Management Group in an attempt at music management and distribution using Starbucks stores. Schultz also became a board member on Dreamworks, trying to establish film output.He began his obsession with Angelina Jolie when she was at a very young age and saw to it that she rose to the celebrity status in her career. It is rumored that the success of the Ray Charles cd fueled Schultz' ambition to murder Charles in an attempt to secure the success of the film. Over the years, he is linked to the deaths of other actors such as Heath Ledger, Anna Nicole Smith, Tupac Shakur, and Notorious BIG. Unfortunately, he is affiliated with a secret group called *Velvet Mafia* in Hollywood. They are rumored to be gay, be responsible for removing Michael Ovitz from his CAA post with a huge power move and stalks young women and men for years to get ideas for their projects. Other members includes David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenburg, Calvin Klein, Tom Ford, and Michael Eisner amongst some others. This has earned him a bad reputation within the Hollywood community. His latest effort to bring his company back on track, he has unaffiliated himself from Concord Management and Dreamworks. However, Starbucks employees have been neglected, mistreated, stalked, harrassed, smeared and defamed under Schultz's management and have repeatedly plagued the company with multi million dollar lawsuits and won. The latest smear attempt came when a 16 year old barista was sexually harrassed by Starbucks management in Irvine, California. In his recent Portfolio magazine in July 2008, he responded to his employees calling him a *psychopath* by suggesting that they should just listen to what the leader of their company tells them. Schultz didn't believe in franchising. Because of this Starbucks owns every domestic outlet with one exception. Schultz went 50-50 with Magic Johnson on stores in minority communities. Others believe the reason why he doesn't franchise I'd because he would like to have access to the video recordings of his employees for private use.  Schultz co-authored a book called Pour Your Heart into It that expounds on his life journey with Starbucks. In his book Schultz admits that he was afraid that """"Starbucks may become another souless big chain."""" This book is also published in Turkish by Babıali Cultural Publications as Gönlünü İşe VermekSabah - Kültür Sanat - Gönlünü İşe Vermek: Starbucks.  Schultz is also the former owner of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. On July 17,2006, it was announced that Schultz sold the team to a group of businessmen from Oklahoma City for $350 million. It was speculated that the new owners would move the team to Oklahoma City some time after the 2006-2007 NBA season.seattletimes.nwsource.com. URL last accessed July 18, 2006. On July 3, 2008, the City of Seattle reached a settlement with the new ownership group and the Sonics did, in fact, move to Oklahoma City.

12986	"""  Binksternet Hello Enric, I just had a very brief discussion with  which went as follows:  Me:   """"Binksternet, User:Kitsunedawn has inserted a new section into Amelia Earhart which is redundant to the paragraph on Gardner Island. The new section also seems to have a bit of a WP:POV issue. I’d rectify the situation myself, but the page is protected. I understand you have some history with the article so I thought you might want to know about it.""""  Binksternet:   """"The added material is far too promotional for TIGHAR. I would like to ask why you, the IP editor from Northern Mississippi, did not remove the text yourself. It is plainly counter to the nominal purpose of putting forward the best available information about Earhart. Nevertheless, I am happy to do so despite the fact that you did not do so.""""  After I finished laughing I started to write a reply, but I realized that if Binksternet could not be bothered to read as far as the third sentence of my first post then there was no reason to think that he would actually read my reply.  I also think that his mention of my geographic location is purposeless.  I am well aware of my own location.  This is not the first time that Binksternet has started shit with me.  Back in November I had this thoroughly unpleasant conversation with Binksternet when I tried to correct a problem with Grey School of Wizardry.  Binksternet indicates (in a picture) on his talk page that he thinks that registration should be required.  And while he is entitled to his own opinion, he isn’t entitled to cast utterly baseless aspersions of impropriety at IP editors.  The last time I wanted to fix a problem with the Earhart article I asked Dougweller to do it, and he was agreeable.  I see now that I should have brought this recent problem to the attention of an administrator, but I had thought it would be helpful to alert Binksternet to the issue because he has a history with the article and would be more likely to keep an eye on the situation than an admin who doesn’t normally edit the article.  Would you please explain to Binksternet that:  1.  I can’t edit the article because it is protected and I have already explained that in my first post.  2.  It isn’t civil to baselessly accuse IP editors of wrongdoing when they are trying to improve Wikipedia and operating in good-faith.  3.  IP editors are allowed to edit Wikipedia.

120948	Wikipedia claims it is an unreliable source   From Wikipedia's WP:RS:  Primary, secondary, and tertiary sources   Main page: Wikipedia:No original research#Primary, secondary and tertiary sources   Wikipedia articles should be based mainly on reliable secondary sources.   Tertiary sources such as compendia, encyclopedias, textbooks, obituaries, and other summarizing sources may be used to give overviews or summaries, but should not be used in place of secondary sources for detailed discussion. Although Wikipedia articles are tertiary sources, Wikipedia employs no systematic mechanism for fact checking or accuracy. Because Wikipedia forbids original research, there is nothing reliable in it that isn't citable with something else.Thus Wikipedia articles (or Wikipedia mirrors) are not reliable sources for any purpose.  I thought the above was a misread, the first time I read it. However, it supports why College Professors and teachers discourage using Wikipedia for academic research. It also means that editors, administrators and others involved with creating articles, are in fact, wasting thier time.   The only person who can gain from Wikipedia, is the fuck-head, money beggar, Jimbo Wales. So all of you who want to edit war, keep it up, you're wasting your fucking time, for nothing. After doing a scan of the Whitman article, since the inclusion and copying of Lavergne's book and other sources, the article is only about 20% accurate. And yes, I am John Moore, who was Houston McCoy's power of attorney, who helped him until Wikipedia came between us when I tried to correct information - a long time ago, and his daughter got involved and help fuel the flames that could have been put out with a reasonable conclusion, if the above info would have been known at the time. But Whitman was my research subject, I helped McCoy because he needed it, he in turn lied to me on several occasions, but I can forgive him for that, at least he had a forgivable condition. Jimbo Wales and Wikipedia, are a sickness unto themselves.  So Pinkafuckup and YGLEE and other IP's who know nothing, have an admin ban me, PLEASE! It won't be necessary, but then, your edit wars were not necessary either. Keep on being the knee pads that Jimbo Smells wants - you deserve!!!2001:558:6007:27:7992:7DA3:D702:EE6A	0

This article is being expanded with material for the first time in years and it'd be easier to keep it separate while its being improved. Clearly the LaRouche movment includes many discrete organizations, many of which have overlapping personnel and aims, and some of which are notable enough on their own for articles. For example, the U.S. Labor Party probably deserves an article because every little political party gets an article. OTOH, the National Democratic Policy Committee, while in some ways equally important, probably doesn't merit an article and should be covered in one of the other LaRouche articles. Most of the PACs or campaign comittees are covered in the presidental campaign articles, but thousands of other candidates also ran under  LaRouche-affilitiated groups.

His first erroneous attempt caused the dynamos to act as a motor/generator combo until the governors were mechanically linked. He wanted the dynamos to work as parallel generators. In the movie, Spencer Tracy distinctly used the term """"bugs"""" for this problem when he first attempted to light up New York City.  Granted, this is a movie. But the term """"bug"""" was obviously used during Edison's invention period for mechanical design issues that needed to be resolved and thus included in the movie.

That article's scope is Western Sahara, not just the SADR, it's simply mis-titled, note that it also includes the Spanish Sahara CoA. See the first two paragraphs of my 18 March post at wp:NPOV Noticeboard#Flag_and_Coat_of_arms_of_Western_Sahara_.2F_SADR, and Talk:Coat_of_arms_of_the_Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic#Move.3F.   In sort tough: During the flag/CoA merges, with CoA articles it was the WS article that was merged into the SADR one, as the SADR article contained nearly all the significant edit history. It was given a WS title via a Technical move request. Someone (not going to unnecessarily publicize his name) has been trying to unilaterally re-split the articles, even tough he's the only one who thinks that should be done and everyone else who has an opinion thinks that there should be one article. He had the Technical move of the merged article undone, on the procedural baces that he objected to it, as a prelude to atemping to unilaterally split the article against conciseness. His split was undone by Dzlinker and myself, hence the poor title which doesn't match the scope.   If on the other hand you think the article gives the Moroccan regional CoA's too much WP:WEIGHT or somthing, that's another matter, and you could discuss it at the NPOV Noticeboard, or maybe the article talk page.	0

You had made some adjustments on that page and I respected and agreed with your decision.  I was wondering if you could write a statement in favor of the 98.223.95.42 edits posted on the village link on the discussion page.  We just need a few more in our favor and the edits will be reverted back to the way it should.  Or if you just want to revert it back yourself.

142739	Establishing this article   Hi. As I set out briefly at my talk page, in order to establish an article on this advertising promotion, you need to be able to demonstrate that the promotion is notable in and of itself as according to the [[WP:N|notability guidelines. To demonstrate this, you need to provide reliable sources. If the advertising campaign has received coverage in industry magazines, for instance, or has one industry awards, that would help establish notability. If it has been discussed by newspapers or popular magazines, that would help establish notability. Sources connected to the parent company cannot be used for this purpose.  The article also needs to be written neutrally and in an encyclopedic manner. It cannot utilize text taken directly from any other website or source unless that text is released under a license consistent with the GFDL.   If an article on this campaign does not meet the above policies and guidelines, it is likely to be deleted or nominated for deletion again. If you have questions about any of these guidelines, you might want to seek additional clarification at the help desk. It can sometimes take a few minutes before you get a reply, but that page is manned around the clock by volunteers, and sooner or later somebody will answer your question.  (talk)	0

63862	I intended the comment about multiplicity to be an exception to the first line about quadratic convergence. You are correct that this is less than clear.  Your suggested phrasing is fine.  Durand-Kerner is Newton's method simultaneously on a vector of root guesses, with the derivative of the polynomial approximated by the derivative of what the polynomial would be if its roots were the current set of guesses.  This permits a lot of redundant computation to be eliminated,  and the algorithm parallelized.  If f(x) is a 4th degree polynomial and p,q,r,s are root approximations, the approximated polynomial is (x-p)(x-q)(x-r)(x-s) and its derivative at p is (p-q)(p-r)(p-s) so a Durand-Kerner iteration for p would be p = p - f(x)/((p-q)(p-r)(p-s)) and iterations of identical form for q, r, and s follow immediately.

I love Wikimedia and everything it is trying to do.  I wanted to be a part of it.  More, I wanted to show its potential.  The worst misconception about me is that I am arrogant about my work.  I most want people to realize that everything I did, they can do too.  You don't even need to do what I did; your own secret hopes and ambitions on here have the potential to succeed.    It's not self-promotion.  If you are contributing work of such high quality that you could actually make a career for yourself, then Wikipedia is damn lucky to have you.  If what you give is crap, face it:  your stuff will be removed, nobody will stick up for you and you'll have zero hopes of ever branching beyond Wikipedia.  This is important:  you should strive to contribute material that is of such high quality people actually think you could be a professional (but the ridiculous argument that you are using Wikipedia to doing that is stupid beyond belief).    I outlined on my blog how I went about doing what I did on here, how you could replicate it if you wanted, and general advice.  I don't care if anyone follows it.  But I certainly hope it explains how unexceptional my contributions were; that is, if only other people attempted what I did.    I'm an artist - I wanted to work on here and give something back.  But I never wish to be a professional photographer or journalist/reporter.  I realize that's a shock for many to believe.  Wikipedia is a great public space to attempt art, whether it be journalism and information as art, or photography that is encyclopedic before it is artistic.    Here's the blog post where I try to explain how I succeeded to gain access, improved my photography and made a reputation for myself simply for doing what I believed in on Wikipedia:  blog.shankbone.org/2008/07/19/david-shankbone-finally-tells-you-how-to-replicate-his-success.aspx  If contributing high quality work that is recognized on and off Wikipedia is self-promotion, then we need more self-promoters who try to create such high quality.

USSR? well, WHO commissioned and published the Protocols for almost 100 years? Oh yeah. RUSSIANS. Egypt's a strawman. Norway?

150687	The basis for this article is an article in Fornvännen 1983  http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1980talet/1983_021.pdf This article was edited and approved by the previous editor of Fornvännen Fil Dr Jan-Peder Lamm  Fornvännen is a highly reputable magazine Göran H. wrote the article in 1982.  Jan-Peder Lamm edited the article but  suggested that Göran H. should include a comparison with Stonehenge. Therefore did J-P L supply Göran H. with archaeological history about Stonehenge. Göran H. re-wrote the article with comparison with Stonhenge and the article was published in 1983.  Jan-Peder Lamm, born 27 October 1935, is a Swedish archaeologist. He received his PhD in 1973 from the University of Stockholm for a dissertation about a Migration Period elite cemetery near Drottningholm. Lamm taught archaeology at the University of Stockholm in the 1970s and then worked until retirement as Head Curator for the Swedish Iron Age at the Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm. He is a member of the editorial board behind the journal Fornvännen and has taken active part in the Helgö project since the 1960s. Fornvännen (print: ISSN 0015-7813, online: ISSN 1404-9430) is a Swedish academic journal in the fields of archaeology and Medieval art. It is published quarterly by the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters in Stockholm, Sweden. The journal's contributions are written in the Scandinavian languages, English, or German with summaries in English. Fornvännen has the alternate title Journal of Swedish Antiquarian Research. The editor in chief is Lars Larsson. Fornvännen began publication in 1906 when it replaced two earlier journals, Svenska Fornminnesföreningens Tidskrift and Vitterhetsakademiens Månadsblad. Early contributors included noted archaeologists Oscar Montelius and Hans Hildebrand.[1] Since 2000 it has an online version, since 2007 its first 100 annual volumes have been available on-line, and since 2009 Fornvännen is published as a delayed open-access journal with the online version of each issue appearing six months after the paper version. Fornvännen is an ERIH category B journal. According to Ulrich's, it is indexed in Anthropological Index Online, Anthropological Literature, British & Irish Archaeological Bibliography (Online Edition), Nordic Archaeological Abstracts, and FRANCIS. It was previously also indexed in Internationale Bibliographie der Rezensionen Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaftlicher Literatur and Linguistic Bibliography.[2] Henriksson, Göran.

42160	The only thing that was a bit thick was my prose.  The old criticism is that if the pedigree were true, then two children of AEthelred II would be marrying two descendants of AEthelric, the first one generation down, the second 4 generations down.  Hart basically rejected this as absurd on its face, that you could have such a 3 generation difference - Edward marrying his brother-in-law's great-grandniece. Kelley argues that Edward was a generation younger than his half-sister, so the three generation difference becomes two.  Eadric at 40 could have married a 18-year old daughter of AEthelred, meaning the generation difference is now only 1.  Edward could have married an Eadgyth a half-generation or more younger than he was, and Eadric could have been a half-generation younger than his brother AEthelmaer, completely removing the chronological problem.  He was basically saying that, as ridiculous as the difference in generations appears on first glance, it is not as unlikely as it might seem.   As to why he is explaining away the AEthelric pedigree, one of the earlier authors had accepted the descend from Wulfric to AEthelmaer, and then suggested that Florence (recte John) had been confused between two AEthelmaers, and that Eadric was not brother of AEthelmaer the Stout.  Kelley is simply saying that this need not be the case, that Eadric could have been brother of AEthelmaer the Stout, that the siblings shown by John of W could all be the children of AEthelweard.  He suggests three possible explanations: A) that one pedigree showing Godwin son of Wulfnoth son of AEthelmaer was mistakenly or fraudulently linked into a second that showed Eadric Streona as son of AEthelric, B) there was an mistaken exchanging two names, such that the authentic pedigree originally showed Eadric, AEthelmaer and an AEthelric as sons of AEthelweard, and somewhere along the lines this was transposed as Eadric, AEthelmaer and AEthelweard as children of AEthelric, or C) that the authentic original pedigree showed the same brothers as sons of AEthel-weard, son of Ead-ric, and a mistaken contraction of these two generations resulted in them simply becoming AEthel-ric. Kelley favors explanation B.	0

110933	"""::::Thank you so much Dudley, you obviously put a lot of time and thought into that response, and I'm extremely grateful. I think I did try to allude to WP:PRIMARY in the FAC, but all too indirectly – for example when I wrote: """"As regards using these sources for historical analysis, I'm quite sure I've not done this, instead just stating what's there, comparable I'd have thought to reading a map?"""" I was aware of WP:PRIMARY, but honestly felt shy of pushing it too hard, for many reasons, one of which was that I was genuinely surprised when the idea of OR was introduced: I had felt sure of my ground but was made to doubt, and, given what you say, perhaps wrongly assumed that everyone commenting there understood WP:PRIMARY better than I. I was also surprised the FAC was archived when it was, and I'm sorry you didn't get a chance to get involved in that discussion.  Your view of """"note 133"""" is quite correct: of course I might say that, but I have direct, personal knowledge of the documents concerned, and have doubted the wisdom of saying so. I felt that explaining that in the FAC might seem arrogant and might anyway make no difference. It would certainly have compromised the degree of anonymity that my user name allows. But my argument that the E 179 database can be regarded as a secondary source is precisely because it's the product of several years' work by professional historians, who were paid by Cambridge University and provided with computing and practical support by the Public Record Office: what the database says is the result of extremely time-consuming historical analysis, and not merely the work of data-inputters. I felt that I did make the argument you suggest about allowable use of primary sources, as well as the argument about secondary, but that those with opposing views simply weren't buying it. Perhaps I should have been more insistent, but even now I'm not sure how I might have done that without angering people who after all are volunteers. Anyway, you're quite right that an FAC isn't the best place to explore a point of principle – nor is your talk page, apologies for going on a bit there! But again I think perhaps I was too shy: it did occur to me to get an uninvolved opinion, but wasn't sure how and was afraid I might be accused of forum-shopping. You mention """"Primary sources talk"""", but I'm not sure where you have in mind – do you mean Wikipedia:No original research/Noticeboard?  Thanks also for the kind words about the Reculver article, I very much appreciated your support at the time and, on the whole, I think the article might even be in better shape now than it was then. That is, barring any minor updates that might be needed, e.g. under """"Governance"""". I think I shall test the issue of the primary sources first, wherever you might suggest, and then, if need be, consider adapting the article to make it redundant. I haven't forgotten that you also previously suggested getting something in print: I'm pretty confident that can be done, but it still hasn't risen to the top of my to-do list. That may change...!

I admit that it is hypothetically possible that opposition to reducing abortion time limits might be motivated by concerns about late diagnosis of fetal abnormalities.  As you know, such abortions account for a very tiny fractions of abortions, but you're correct that concern about such situations could hypothetically cause someone to block a general reduction in time limits.  However, RCOG has said it is pro-choice, explicitly supporting """"rights of women to exercise personal choice.""""

106035	"""  Checking the history of Irving Kupcinet's career will establish who was familiar with him.  I believe you are arguing just to be arguing.    Washington, DC might not have been a mecca for Hollywood movies in 1963, but it was a respectable newspaper market where Irving Kupcinet would have loved to gain more readers.  But he didn't.  His column never reached that city.  All the way until he retired in 2001, very few people in the DC area gave a damn who he was or who his Hollywood friends were.  I was there.  And I can prove Kup's column never was.  If you don't want to be """"little known"""" outside of Chicago, then you better make friends in DC.  It's the Shakespeare capital of the Western Hemisphere because of all the pressure to succeed academically and in public service, but it still has migrants from Illinois  the land of Kupcinet and his name dropping.  Do you know how many people have to work for a congressman or a senator ?  Yet these Illinois people in DC could not read Kup's column when they got homesick.  They couldn't introduce other DC people to Kup's column.    He was little known outside Chicago, indeed.  So he had something on a network for six months on which Carolyn Jones appeared ?  That's nothing.  In the 1950s the networks were begging for commentators to go on live television, and they came and went without any impact.  Carolyn Jones needed all the exposure she could get.  Her career wasn't on the level of Audrey Hepburn's.  My addition to the article allows that Kupcinet was well - known in Chicago and Los Angeles.  Elsewhere he was a ship passing in the night. News flash: there was no Internet when Karyn Kupcinet died.  Let's see someone other than Wildhartlivie say Irving Kupcinet was well-known outside Chicago and Los Angeles.  Wildhartlivie did a great job on the man's resume, but let's be realistic about who would have given a damn about his daughter's death a month after it happened.   """	0

The irony is, even though this close air support version was cancled, the F-16 has engaged in close air support (CAS) in every major conflict (for the U.S.) it has flown in, up to and including present day operations in Iraq.  Your definition of ground attack is skewed.

100321	Energy certificates  It is assumed there is some reason why users continually refer to energy credit while it has been pointed out that this is a misnomer in regard to Technocracy ideas.  Energy Accounting is a hypothetical system of distribution, which would record the Energy used to produce and distribute goods and services consumed by citizens in a Technate. The units of this accounting system would be known as Energy CertificatesThese would replace money in a Technate, but unlike traditional money or currencies, energy certificates could not be saved or earned, only distributed evenly among a populace. The amount of certificates given to each citizen would be calculated by determining the total productive capacity of the technate and dividing it equally. The Energy Certificates themselves would probably not have to be physically used by the populace, as the system would be computerised. In energy accounting the Technate would use information of Natural resources, industrial capacity and citizen’s purchasing habits to determine how much of any good or service was being consumed by the populace, so that it could match production with consumption.  The reason for the use of Energy Accounting serves to ensure the highest possible standard of living as well as equality among the Technate’s citizenry, as well as prohibit spending that is beyond the productive capacity of the technocracy.Energy Accounting An article on Energy Accounting as proposed by Technocracy Inc. Technocrats point out that energy accounting is not rationing; it is a way to distribute an abundance and track demand. Everyone would receive an equal, abundant (i.e. far more than they need), amount of energy certificates. Technocrats predict that at today's rates of energy conversion, no person will rationally be able to spend all their energy certificates.	0

20897	Hi Scorpion,. I'm a bit aggravated as I provided a valid source from Canada's Walk of Fame saying that Ryan Reynolds will not be inducted on October 1, 2011 like it states in your edit. The way that you put is that we should ignore the source and just merge the columns on  the night of October 1, but according to sources, Reynolds will be unable to attend and he will be inducted at a later date, and will not be featured on the televised gala. It states that he will be inducted at a later date whether it be 2011 or 2012. (We don't know the specifics) If you merge the two columns on October 1, you are providing an untruth with regards as not all announced 2011 inductees will be inducted on the same day.  WWe should keep Ryan Reynolds seperate from the other inductees until we know for sure when he will be able to get his star.  I'm sorry to get angry at you, but I think I am within the right to add this edit on to the page because I provided a valid source from the official commitee that says that one person's involvement has been postponed, and all that you are doing is reverting my edits, trying to sweep this fact under the carpet. As you said in your previous edit, why should it matter if the two columns will be merged in a month? Well, I thought Wikipedia was based on facts and sources, which I thought I had provided and you are selectfully omitting certain details thus allowing some inconsistencies in the article itself. You are the one that will be merging the two columns, and I don't think it would be fair and truthful to just merge Ryan Reynolds along with the other 2011 inductees into the main grid, if we still do not know when he will get inducted. That's what's getting me upset at your ways at handling the page. I did nothing wrong, just provided a valid source and I truly believe that tthere should be some sort of indication on the page at least that Ryan Reynold could not attend on October 1 due toi a scheduling conflict until we know of what will happen with Ryan Reynolds and Canada's walk of Fame.

134213	Hi - Laguna icon Please check my edit on this, since, the official Supreme Court of the Philippines published this forthwith. Since you are a close relative of Arturo D. Brion, please be informed, as I will also inform our Filipino editors in Tambayan, that the entire judiciary will be at half mast to mourn Judge Edon Brion's demise amid necrological services, being the main feature and the November 22, 2008, burial near your barrio, in San Pablo City. As you had known, I sat beside Arturo D. Brion's wife, my seat and classmate Antonietta from 1978-1982, Ateneo Law School. And I accepted God's will for me as closed Catholic amid my strong faith when I predicted the Supreme Court appointment of Brion as the Benjamin of the Court, way back on 2003 when I can't forget the pansit canton the spouses served me in Pandacan, Manila, so memorable. And Arturo D. Brion, signed the final Court resolution which put the final nail to my judicial career's coffin on June 3, 2008, exactly 25 years from June 3, 1983, when LUIS, Armand and Angel, holy angels of God first faced destiny and me-my brother Robert. Judge and Justice Brion are our icon. I had continuously prayed Psalm 109 as you noted in your email to me. Peace of Christ!

62152	"""=Unbalanced critique===  The psychotherapy article needs a balanced critique section. The current article contains a section called """"criticisms and questions regarding effectiveness"""" in which a few random studies have been cited, and a laundry list of random arguments are put forward. It is not a comprehensive precis of the effectiveness literature. The article neglects a wide body of work that points to a) the success of some types of therapy with specific types of disorders, b) discipline-agnostic characteristics of therapist behaviour that contribute to success, c) superiority of psychopharmacology & psychotherapy combined, vs either intervention on it's own, d) characteristics of clients/patients that seem to benefit most from psychotherapy, and e) vested interests of stakeholders in swinging research to one side of the debate or the other and other inhibiting factors - consider the two APA's, the various laws and licensing authorities, the separate academic communities in psychiatry, philosophy, social work, occupational therapy, the professional jealousies, the profound neglect of mental illness and psychological wellbeing in public health and health insurance, and the impact of the pharmaceutical industry's deep pockets on the dominant discourse.    Please note that I am editing anonymously in protest against the tyrrany of the editing majority. Wikipedia's non-negotiable, amateur editor norm might be appropriate for certain article categories, but in more nuanced technical spaces there is invariably a segment that make nuisances of themselves by wanting to debate every word and angle. I have watched the development of articles on schools of psychotherapy since the early 2000s, and I'm afraid time and multiple amateur edits have not improved them much. In the specific case of psychology their mistakes add to the perception that this is a wishy washy discipline void of a body of knowledge and ANY facts. I suspect that this is partly why self-respecting people who are knowledgeable don't want to be involved in what is otherwise a very worthy undertaking.   — Preceding unsigned comment added by 41.242.118.144     =="""	0

119587	Explanation   OTRS is for the people who have to answer Wikipedia's e-mail. We got a very polite letter from the prince's son explaining that his father was 100% mentally normal, and asking that we please remove this false and defamatory statement.	0
86719	friends' suspicions   The article says: Schiavo's friends began to have suspicions about her eating habits. After meals out, she would immediately excuse herself to go to the bathroom.  Which friends? Friends from Pennsylvania? New friends in Florida? This article needs to be specific here - otherwise it sounds like hearsay. Furthermore, the article needs to clear. Which friends? Who!	0
92604	"""I don't know anyone who has entertained the belief that Bacon had buggered Jonson. As for his servants, that may be a different matter. Bray suspects that it may have been the money Bacon gave them that brought the matter to notice: certainly, homosexual relations between masters and servants were clearly common enough to provoke the satirists. As for the weight allotted to it in the article: this is a classic situation in Wikipedia. Any implication of homosexuality in an historical figure has to be detailed and fully referenced beyond normal expectation, otherwise it is then accused of being an unsupported allegation, with the resulting endless edit war. In addition, the earlier point made on this thread about including it: """"Because a significant amount of modern scholarship is focused on how it affected the development of his ontology"""" is extremely valid. The growth of gay studies departments within universities in recent years, and the flood of research and interpretation, is having a significant impact, and is literally re-writing history. To give a tiny example: the discoveries and interpretations in Crompton's 'Byron and Greek Love' have affected every Byron biography published after 1985. Multiply this a thousand times, and one gets an idea of the tsunami of change. For the homophobic this presents a confronting situation, but it's the reality.   """	0
